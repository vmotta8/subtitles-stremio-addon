<i>welcome to the the kelly file,
i'm megyn kelly.</i>

4
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,700
<i>breaking tonight, polls are moving,
the race is changing.</i>

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,982
<i>and more than a dozen republican(republicano) candidates
are trying to make themselves heard</i>

6
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:48,054
<i>with a little more than one week left
to the debate that could change everything.</i>

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,693
<i>and we are the gateway.
we the questioners(questionadores) are the gateways,</i>

8
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:53,284
<i>we at fox and cnn and everybody else
who gets a chance</i>

9
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,938
<i>to actually moderate a presidential(presidencial) debate
with these guys.</i>

10
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,852
<i>i mean, these guys, they deserve
to face tough questioning.</i>

11
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,772
<i>as chris says and i agree,</i>

12
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,296
<i>they want george washington's job,
and they better earn it.</i>

13
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,803
<i>they better show the american people
they are worthy of it.</i>

14
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:09,517
<i>a lot of folks assume donald trump
would flame out by now.</i>

15
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,649
<i>they have been proven wrong.</i>

16
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:13,787
<i>now, wait, here.
we've got to get to this.</i>

17
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:16,271
<i>because this is just breaking
on "the daily beast."</i>

18
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:21,934
<i>the headline is ex-wife, donald trump
made me feel violated during sex.</i>

19
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:25,834
<i>ivana trump(trunfo) once accused
the real estate tycoon of, quote, "rape."</i>

20
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:29,261
<i>somebody who speaks for donald trump
has come out and denied it as well.</i>

21
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:34,481
<i>and added that legally he says,
you cannot rape your spouse.</i>

22
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:38,690
<i>here's the one thing you probably know
about me: i have a big mouth.</i>

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,080
roger, you have megyn on line one.

24
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,811
- megyn.
- morning, roger.

25
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,873
what'd you do to piss off trump?

26
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:50,187
we did a segment(segmento) on a recent coverage
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

27
00:01:50,187 --> 00:01:53,181
you're giving that oxygen
before the first goddamn debate?

28
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:57,852
roger, we had a full screen
of ivana's recantation, which is soft.

29
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,984
she accused him during a divorce.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,773
his lawyer, michael cohen, claims
you can't rape a spouse, pissed me off.

31
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,865
great, the future of fox news
is now a goddamn feminist.

32
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:10,036
no, i'm not a feminist, i'm a lawyer.

33
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:12,328
we need him. clean this up. now!

34
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:18,400
<i>unfortunately, when it comes to
politicians and the media,</i>

35
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:20,485
<i>roger ailes knows his shit.</i>

36
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:24,132
<i>appointed head of the fox news channel
by media mogul rupert murdoch.</i>

37
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:28,102
<i>roger transformed cable news,
barging fox to the forefront.</i>

38
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,391
<i>years before, to get nixon elected,
he created the modern town home debate.</i>

39
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,248
<i>to get reagan elected, he made him
address the elephant in the room.</i>

40
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:39,690
<i>i will not make age
an issue of this campaign.</i>

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,672
<i>i am not going to exploit my opponent's
youth and inexperience.</i>

42
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,871
<i>to get george h. w. bush elected,
somebody did a willie horton(nepotismo) ads.</i>

43
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:51,513
<i>roger denies it was him, a lot.</i>

44
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,542
<i>i have been astounded
at the number of americans</i>

45
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,343
<i>who are fine with our country
moving in a socialist direction.</i>

46
00:02:58,388 --> 00:02:59,726
here we go.

47
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:04,530
news is like a ship.

48
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,443
you take your hands off the wheel
and it pulls hard to the left.

49
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:11,218
look at this.

50
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:15,833
james murdoch, tell me
those lips haven't sucked cock.

51
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,746
this is what nepotism(geraldo) gets him.

52
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:27,588
roger, rules fox from behind
these doors on the second floor.

53
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:32,117
when employees say "the second floor",
they mean roger,

54
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:36,636
or the many vps pay to enact(waver) his will
without qualms(terminalmente) or questions.

55
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:39,765
now i know what some of you
are thinking, and no,

56
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:42,248
roger does not tell us
what to say on air.

57
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:43,212
he doesn't have to.

58
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:44,853
- love that dress, megyn.
- thank you.

59
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:46,410
no, really, i love it.

60
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:50,165
he is not horny.
he's just ambitious.

61
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,028
<i>roger is always watching.</i>

62
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,111
<i>the eagles postpone their appearance</i>

63
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:58,394
<i>because co-founder glenn frey
is too ill to travel...</i>

64
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:01,391
morons.

65
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,497
the phone in his office connects
directly to the control room

66
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,259
which is down on the first floor.

67
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:10,288
yes, sir?

68
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:13,355
you fucking idiots! that's not
glenn frey, that's don henley.

69
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,502
dump the b-roll.
back to anchor.

70
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,411
that's not glenn frey,
that's don fucking henley.

71
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,188
what the fuck kayla?!

72
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:22,613
i'm sorry, i don't know secular music.

73
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,692
the eagles?

74
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,114
only the biggest band of the 70s.

75
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,672
when my mom was a toddler.

76
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:29,059
they all look the same,
they're just old.

77
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:32,860
down in the basement
is the fox newsroom.

78
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:36,194
all our shows have crews
who work in these pods.

79
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:38,860
this is my staff.

80
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,398
hey, guys.

81
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,046
from below the city,
so it smells like mold.

82
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:46,542
but there hasn't been
a rat citing in four months.

83
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,073
the anchors(âncoras) and their
key producers(produtores) have base camps.

84
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,511
here, on 17th and 18th.
often decorated with viewer(visualizador) art.

85
00:04:57,627 --> 00:05:02,397
and everyone in this building,
even roger, answers to 8th.

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,636
the 8th floor is home to ceo
rupert murdoch and his sons.

87
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:09,817
this is the power behind the power.

88
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,722
the actual studios are scattered
around the building.

89
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:15,649
most anchor(âncora) and show offices are here,

90
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:20,156
above our fox business, radio,
new york post and the wall street journal.

91
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,409
most of the american conservative
establishment in one building.

92
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,940
<i>the stage is finally set for tonight's
republican debate in cleveland.</i>

93
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,300
<i>all the candidates(fundição) are looking
for a boost tonight,</i>

94
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,512
<i>but only 10 of them have a chance
to appeal to voters in the prime time.</i>

95
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,956
trump has a real problem with women.

96
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:49,744
i wanna ask about it.

97
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,336
did you back that up?

98
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,036
yes.

99
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,885
good morning.

100
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,756
morning, chris.

101
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,869
excuse me.

102
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,029
do you think that's it?

103
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,528
sorry.

104
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,027
it's probably nerves.

105
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,275
no. when it's nerves
i hear my heart.

106
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,765
i can't hear it.

107
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,765
that's your first question?

108
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,830
is this some feminist(feminista) thing?

109
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,560
she's not a feminist.

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,481
it goes to his electability.

111
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,670
did you run it pass tom lowell?

112
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,280
he didn't go after trump.

113
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,891
the second floor said that?

114
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,152
no.

115
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,975
the 8th. the murdochs.

116
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:06,460
rupert called roger and said
about trump: "enough is enough."

117
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:09,527
look, all trump(trunfo) does is watch fox.

118
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:13,430
roger gave him air for his
crazy theories and idiot grievances.

119
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:14,763
why?

120
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:17,186
'cause roger shares a lot of them.

121
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:19,014
are you sure you wanna
take that on?

122
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,758
yes.

123
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,340
i don't know if these are strong enough,
but they help with nausea.

124
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,101
you go live in five hours.

125
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,821
i'll be fine.

126
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:33,289
okay.

127
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,945
if you can try to keep it down.

128
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,995
fuck, stop making that face, julia.

129
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,586
i'm not making a face.

130
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:44,939
five hours?

131
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,508
- yeah.
- okay.

132
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,764
don't worry. we're behind you.

133
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,295
way behind you.

134
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:01,099
there's a blanket on the chair,
and just in case, a trash can beside.

135
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:21,961
<i>mr. trump, one of the things
people love about you</i>

136
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:25,083
<i>is you speak your mind
and you don't use a politician's filter.</i>

137
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:29,611
<i>however, that is not without its downsides,
in particular, when it comes to women.</i>

138
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,533
<i>you've called women you don't like:</i>

139
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:37,042
<i>"fat pigs, dogs, slobs,
and disgusting animals."</i>

140
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,311

141
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,161
<i>your twitter account...</i>

<i>your twitter account...</i>

146
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,721
<i>yes, i'm sure it was.</i>

147

<i>your twitter account has several
disparaging comments about women's looks.</i>

<i>does that sound to you like the temperament

151
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,584

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,316
<i>that you are a part
of the war on women?</i>

154
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:18,386
<i>call me stupid, but i thought
he'd respect the challenge.</i>

155
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:20,941
trump is pissed.

156
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,965
he was up all night tweeting.

157
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,634
crap, really?

158
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:25,986
what was he tweeting?

159
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:28,774
"fox viewers(espectadores) give low marks
to bimbo megyn kelly."

160
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,968
i hate that word.

161
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:33,153
it says you're too sexy to be smart,
but not smart enough to be sexy.

162
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,716
"wow, megan kelly
really bombed tonight.

163
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:37,967
people going wild
on twitter. funny to watch."

164
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,500
donald trump. donald trump.

165
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:42,679
okay.

166
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,114
how many times did he tweet?

167
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:45,159
like 15.

168
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,585
- fift...
- yeah.

169
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,282
he's never gonna be president.

170
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:51,297
wait.

171
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:52,945
am i gonna be the story?

172
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:54,196
no.

173
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:56,215
i'm gonna be the story?

174
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:57,596
no.

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,490
gretchen's giving this 2 blocks?
it's that far down the food chain?

176
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,169
we should get you a security team.

177
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,576
think it over. a trump(trunfo) called
me before the debate.

178
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:13,082
he said he knew that
your first question was harsh.

179
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,949
- how could he know that?
- no idea.

180
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:17,836
i sure didn't.

181
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,282
it was good tv. unexpected.
goddamn tough.

182
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,010
proud of you megyn.

183
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,487
thanks, roger.

184
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,263
heard you were sick.

185
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,858
yeah.

186
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,979
i think it was in my coffee.

187
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,910
- where did you get it?
- my driver.

188
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,314
he insisted on some
fancy coffee joint.

189
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,684
you know this guy?

190
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,803
no, he's a driver, roger.

191
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:45,730
- did you know him?
- no.

192
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,987
you know better than that!

193
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:51,432
<i>okay, yes. roger ailes is paranoid.</i>

194
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:53,138
<i>but his parents were nuts.</i>

195
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,810
<i>as he drove off to college
they filed for divorce.</i>

196
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,940
<i>and didn't tell him.</i>

197
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,733
<i>at christmas, he came home to find
strangers in his house, and all his things,</i>

198
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:03,668
<i>photos, and yearbooks,
and trophies thrown out.</i>

199
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:08,181
<i>is it any wonder the man created
a nostalgia machine for lost america?</i>

200
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,274
this is crazy.

201
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:15,276
we're sitting here wondering if a candidate
for president poisoned my coffee.

202
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:18,027
it's only crazy until it happens,
and it happens.

203
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,956
i hate being the story.

204
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:24,872
i'll call trump, you go on vacation,
stay above it all.

205
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,071
he won't dent your ratings.

206
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:30,128
nobody stops watching
because of the conflict.

207
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,904
they stop watching
when there isn't one.

208
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:34,342
some viewers(espectadores) will listen to him.

209
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:38,348
well, some, but as long as he keeps saying
megyn kelly is unwatchable,

210
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:41,396
that means he's watching it,
they know that.

211
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,681
and they'll watch what he watches.

212
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,771
you'll be okay.

213
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:48,066
see you in a week.

214
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,085
drink up buddy boy.

215
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,288
thank you.

216
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,798
here's to a week of no kids
but my own.

217
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,118
cheers.

218
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:58,397
okay. frank bruni, the times:

219
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,645
"the debate was riveting,
it was admirable,"

220
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,140
it compels me to write
a cluster of words

221
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,776
"i never imagined writing,
hooray for fox news."

222
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,038
that's gonna make you happy.
appraisal, tangled up, and then insult.

223
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:09,906
it doesn't make me happy, gil.

224
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,499
<i>you could see that was blood
coming out of her eyes,</i>

225
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:14,622
<i>blood coming out of her... wherever...</i>

226
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:15,235
oh my god!

227
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,854
did he just accused me
of anger menstruating?

228
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,481
yes.

229
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:21,717
i'm calling roger.

230
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:25,048
no, i'll talk to him.
take a vacation, i'll handle this.

231
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,463
doug.

232
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,225
<i>would you like to correct yourself
on that other talking point,</i>

233
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:31,916
<i>about men being dominant?</i>

234
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,117
<i>we don't have any time.</i>

235
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:35,798
<i>we're running over.</i>

236
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,122
<i>hr's on the phone
'cause you called me a skirt.</i>

237
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,077
<i>i gotta read that manual again.</i>

238
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:41,793
<i>i'll bring it to your office
right after the show.</i>

239
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,813
<i>some guy came up to me and said:
"i saw you on 'fox & friends' this morning.</i>

240
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,965
<i>is gretchen as cute in person
as she is on tv?"</i>

241
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,776
<i>and what did you answer him, eric?</i>

242
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:51,200
<i>beautiful dress. you look wonderful.
great color.</i>

243
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,935
<i>in summary, gretchen's beautiful.</i>

244
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,016
<i>beautiful. you look beautiful.
thank you.</i>

245
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,046
<i>well, you look fabulous too!</i>

246
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,345
<i>she got a wax?
doesn't waxing hurt?</i>

247
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:00,742
<i>he looks at me for that.</i>

248
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:03,242
<i>women are everywhere, we're letting
them play golf and tennis now.</i>

249
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,906
<i>it's out of control.</i>

250
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,133
<i>you read the headlines,
since men are so great.</i>

251
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,856
<i>she needed a shower.</i>

252
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,792
we had to turn off camera,
it was even worse.

253
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,256
steve simply started ignoring me.

254
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,712
what did mr. ailes say
when you complained?

255
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:19,575
he said:

256
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,716
"you act like it only rains on women."

257
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:24,842
"stop getting goddamn offended
by everything."

258
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:26,521
"you're a men hater."

259
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:27,836
and...

260
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,172
"learn to get along with the boys."

261
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,134
and he took me off the show.

262
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,897
but gave you your own.

263
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,705
afternoon dead zone.

264
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:37,626
it was a demotion,
and we both knew it.

265
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:40,976
even though i did increase
the ratings(classificações) by 15%.

266
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,724
he moved me to second base.

267
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:49,541
<i>back in minnesota, before i graduated
summa cum laude(faye) from stanford,</i>

268
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,123
<i>before, i was crowned miss america.</i>

269
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:54,893
<i>i played second base
in the 6th grade softball league.</i>

270
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,733
<i>i hate second base.</i>

271
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:02,309
did he ever offer to reverse
that decision if you made yourself

272
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:03,986
sexually available?

273
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,639
not directly.

274
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:08,575
with roger, it's always about loyalty.

275
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,946
he says he can fix things
if you're loyal,

276
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:13,606
and you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

277
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:16,156
we don't guess.

278
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,152
oral sex.

279
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:20,536
roger likes to joke:

280
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,619
"to get ahead you gotta
give a little head."

281
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,839
really.

282
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:28,552
but mr. ailes never unambiguously
asks for oral(menstruação) sex?

283
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:31,996
it was always just a joke,
a put down, like:

284
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,779
"you're sexy,
but you're too much work."

285
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:38,045
i have a whole list in here.

286
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,442
because that's just how roger is.

287
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:41,878
what do you want out of a lawsuit?

288
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:45,345
what do i want?
i want this behavior to stop.

289
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,597
someone has to speak up.
someone has to get mad.

290
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:50,749
that may not be you.

291
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:55,032
your contract will have a clause
requiring secret mandatory arbitration.

292
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:56,754
you familiar with
rudi bakhtiar's case?

293
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:57,242
yes.

294
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:58,767
you're supposed to be.

295
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:01,880
my first act as d.c. bureau chief.

296
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,189
i want you down here full time.

297
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:08,965
oh my god! that's amazing. yes!

298
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:10,564
you do know what this means for you?

299
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,595
<i>shit, he doesn't think i'm ready.</i>

300
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:16,515
brian, i will not let you down.
i'm gonna bust my ass for you.

301
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,508
rudi, come one, that's a given.

302
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,168
<i>so what's the problem?</i>

303
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,860
but... look...

304
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,015
you do get how i feel
about you, right?

305
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,415
<i>oh fuck! fuck!</i>

306
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:33,272
i'm glad you said that, brian.

307
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,064
because i really respect you too.

308
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,748
no. no. i mean...

309
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,824
how i really feel.

310
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,721
<i>just look confused.</i>

311
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:49,068
all i want from you, rudi, is to see
the inside of your hotel room.

312
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,228
<i>goddammit!</i>

313
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,542
that's all it's gonna take.

314
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,317
<i>don't react. make it your fault.</i>

315
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,140
brian, if i've done anything
to make you think

316
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,901
i feel that way
about you, i apologize.

317
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,194
<i>friends.</i>

318
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,019
we're friends.

319
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:05,982
<i>professionals.</i>

320
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:08,455
we have a great professional vibe.

321
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,808
<i>now sell it.</i>

322
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:12,741
i just don't do that,
i've never had to do that for a job.

323
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,016
i know. i know...

324
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,287
you know i'd kill for d.c.

325
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:19,281
but there is no way
i'm showing you my hotel room.

326
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,921
<i>this is gonna ruin my career.</i>

327
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:26,839
now i feel like a creep.

328
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:29,943
no. you're so not.

329
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:32,032
<i>fucking creep.</i>

330
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,953
they fired me.

331
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,439
i'm a lousy reporter, apparently.

332
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:42,159
assholes.

333
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,535
she proved what they
wanted her to prove.

334
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:49,653
no one really wins
by suing(processamento) fox news.

335
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:54,353
it's been our experience that
once you go public in your job.

336
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,108
no one will hire you.

337
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:01,161
if you're able to stick it out at fox,
gather more evidence,

338
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:05,714
you might be able to sue
ailes himself, instead of fox.

339
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:08,624
and that is why i'm here,
because martin hayman(homem de feno) told me

340
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:14,871
that over here, in new jersey, i can avoid
arbitration by suing(processamento) roger, personally.

341
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:16,795
he says that you've managed
to change the law,

342
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:19,752
and that we could call
other women and show a pattern.

343
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,621
will other women come forward?

344
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,239
yes. they will.

345
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,584
you live and work in new york.

346
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,361
roger has a house
in bergen(resgatando) county,

347
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,772
where he stays when he can't
make it upstate.

348
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:31,842
you did your homework, ms. carlson.

349
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,742
no fingerprints.

350
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:36,733
that's how much i practiced
the violin as a child.

351
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,908
if roger finds out you came to us,
he won't just fire you.

352
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:43,944
he will bang us with
a million dollar lawsuit,

353
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:46,214
he will attack you personally.

354
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:49,346
these men care more about
their reputations than they do money.

355
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:50,781
roger won't stop.

356
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,275
- oh, i know.
- you know that?

357
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:57,098
colleagues you admire will say publicly
you're superior ambitious woman

358
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,334
who's suing(processamento) because
her career staled.

359
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,408
let them.

360
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:08,865
okay. if we work hard,
you might be lucky enough

361
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:13,223
to watch the most powerful man in tv
go after you with everything he's got.

362
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:16,935
thank you.

363
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:22,108
i'm telling you, other women
will come forward.

364
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:24,493
let's hope.

365
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:28,292
frankly, i think you have a gap
in the network, mr. shine.

366
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,865
there are millions of young
conservatives in this country.

367
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,695
you can look at my
instagram account, there are.

368
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:37,498
they don't have a voice
on your network.

369
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:41,350
i see myself as an influencer
in the jesus space.

370
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,560
don't get me wrong, i've learned
a ton from gretchen,

371
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,547
i truly have, of course, but...

372
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:51,426
no judgment here, my perspective
as an evangelical(salsicha) millennial,

373
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,762
it's just not that helpful to her.

374
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:57,047
to be honest, mr. shine.

375
00:18:57,196 --> 00:19:01,434
she's sort of establishment
with a capital "e".

376
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:04,093
that's why i wanted
to talk to you in private.

377
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:07,362
kayla, before we move you up.

378
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,498
i wanna ask you something personal.

379
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,250
what do you think of our slogan?

380
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,176
fair and balanced.

381
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,931
i'm glad you asked.

382
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,708
our new shows and our
opinion shows are very different.

383
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,968
our news is impartial.
it's top of the line.

384
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,858
our opinion shows...

385
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,499
roger gave a voice to people
who didn't have one,

386
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,621
and he balanced
the american conversation.

387
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:38,223
so, our news people are fair.

388
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,921
our entertainers(bergen) are very
necessary form of balance.

389
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,683
attagirl. perfect.

390
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,774
but today, we're sticking up for girls

391
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,480
on international day of the girl.

392
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,036
and for the first time
on cable news, here i am

393
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,610
makeup free - for a reason.

394
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,683
tomorrow i'll be back
in my regular makeup.

395
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:06,894
and i thank the other brave women
who came on today, show, sounds makeup.

396
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:09,543
let's continue to tell our girls -

397
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:11,952
just be yourself.

398
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:13,278
check.

399
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,453
great show.

400
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:17,109
get me some makeup.

401
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:21,708
i have some bad news,
kayla is leaving us for the asshole.

402
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,339
o'reilly?

403
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,801
it is our highest rated program.

404
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,692
and we can't be?

405
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,703
no. i believe in real story.

406
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:32,295
did you just see that segment?
did you see it? did you see...

407
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,534
we're doing something unique here.

408
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,328
together. all of us.

409
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:38,018
- can you just...
- sure.

410
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,062
listen to me.

411
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,127
i can get you where you wanna be.

412
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:46,144
i can protect you,
just don't get ahead of yourself.

413
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,245
you have a lot to learn,
i can teach you.

414
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:51,460
i'm not getting ahead of myself, gretchen.
i'm taking the next step.

415
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,099
i learn by doing.

416
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,790
come on. come on. please.

417
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:58,383
i'm confused. you want me
to pass on a promotion so

418
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,956
you can help me get the same promotion
on a show with worse ratings.

419
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,209
i want a little loyalty. i need loyalty.

420
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,470
women together.

421
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,337
i'm loyal to the network.

422
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,423
it's not us versus them, gretchen.

423
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:12,116
miss america!

424
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:16,251
roger. hi there.
this is the treat.

425
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,044
what the fuck are you doing?

426
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:21,315
a segment(segmento) on how
we oversexualize(superexualizar) women.

427
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:23,496
you said be more of myself.

428
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:27,056
you know what makeup does?
keeps everybody from seeing you sweat.

429
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:31,115
most of the mean tweets that i received
are about my appearance.

430
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,664
so, it is important that we fight back
against this kind of bullying.

431
00:21:33,664 --> 00:21:35,003
bullying isn't meanness.

432
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,656
bullying is people with more power
hitting people with less.

433
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,274
these jack-asses have cell phones.

434
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:42,198
you have fucking tv-show!

435
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,867
we have to fight the objectification.

436
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,270
bullshit!

437
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,273
mouth shot. ears open.

438
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:54,367
nobody wants to watch a middle-aged woman
sweat away through menopause.

439
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,821
not on a national fucking television!

440
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,681
thank you for the advice.

441
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,257
objectification...

442
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:08,207
all right.

443
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,331
gretchen, i really appreciate...

444
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:11,058
shut up!

445
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,341
good luck.

446
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:28,660
good one, honey.

447
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:37,252
hey.

448
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:40,044
it's a zoo here.
phones ringing off the hook.

449
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:42,709
anyone care he called me bimbo?

450
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:43,915
not really.

451
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:45,957
he tweeted the gq photo.

452
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,713
- and?
- torn.

453
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,435
god, i'd love to be slut-shamed.

454
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:54,003
gil wants to ask again
if we should make a statement.

455
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,316
no. no response. zero.

456
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,997
doug just lost. i gotta go.

457
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,373
next time, honey.

458
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:04,741
good game.

459
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:06,904
trump. sixteen.

460
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,791
excuse me.

461
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,835
if you talk to my wife again,
i'll beat you to a fucking pulp.

462
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,237
that was weird.

463
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,878
you're getting some action.

464
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:20,691
oh really?

465
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:33,304
oh, man!

466
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,847
asshole.

467
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,646
you don't have to worry about trump.
you're tougher than all of those guys.

468
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:40,872
you just gotta worry
about the crazies.

469
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:42,549
i can handle a few crazies.

470
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:45,523
trump will stop once he feels
he's won the argument.

471
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:49,084
i feel like he's less interested
in winning the argument than just

472
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:54,574
having the argument with you in public
to prove he can take on the establishment.

473
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:56,284
i'm not the establishment.

474
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:59,456
honey, get real. you are
the establishment(estabelecimento) now.

475
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:01,422
- mommy!
- not yet.

476
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:06,333
you do understand i have
to be above this, right?

477
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:08,986
i have to be an anchor(âncora) first,
then a woman.

478
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:12,415
the entire country is talking
about your period right now.

479
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:14,700
- mommy!
- what?

480
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,802
there's a man.

481
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:16,463
what?

482
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:18,248
- yardley!
- look, he's right there!

483
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,973
yardley, where is he?

484
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,518
jesus, he's got a fucking camera!

485
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:22,373
come here, honey.

486
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,548
no. no. don't open the door.
they can't sell 'em if we're inside.

487
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,689
get out! get outta here! go!

488
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,231
what were you guys doing?

489
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,023
mommy and daddy?

490
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,628
it was a crossword...

491
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:38,972
mommy was just taking
a quick little nap.

492
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:41,374
- quick one.
- it wasn't that quick.

493
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:44,355
i'm gonna have
to call roger about security.

494
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:48,862
<i>as clear as a bell that megyn kelly
has gone over to the dark side.</i>

495
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:52,804
<i>the more she sells out
the wider(mais amplo) her nostrils(narinas) have become.</i>

496
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:55,287
<i>listen to what i just said,
have you seen them flair?</i>

497
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,919
<i>this woman was once pretty.</i>

498
00:24:57,243 --> 00:25:00,356
<i>and the more she has sold out
the wider(mais amplo) her nostrils(narinas) have become.</i>

499
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:03,653
<i>they're almost porcine.
she snorts her insults at america...</i>

500
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:05,443
roger.

501
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:11,696
give me a day to figure out
how we hit trump(trunfo) back.

502
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:12,972
stop by later.

503
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:14,557
i don't want my kids
hearing this crap.

504
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:16,440
ignore the damn morons.

505
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:21,103
i'm old, fat, and ugly.
christ, the call me jabba(exibicionista) the hutt.

506
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:25,208
hemophilia swells
my joints, can't exercise.

507
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:27,936
i feel fine but i look like shit.

508
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,264
and look the opposite of how i feel.

509
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:31,708
do i let it affect me?

510
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,984
no. i do not.

511
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,749
this isn't entirely true.

512
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,059
roger's also fat because he only get
a room service menu on order page two.

513
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:43,100
no goddamn orange on fox!

514
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,084
but he cares a lot about looks.

515
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:47,898
<i>let's turn our attention to south korea.</i>

516
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:50,595
<i>south korean official say
talks with the north have...</i>

517
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,865
early on he realized for a network
to stay on 24 hours a day

518
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:58,090
you need something
to hold an audience.

519
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,977
that something is legs.

520
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:06,313
there's a reason for clear desks.

521
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,136
we need you in a shorter dress.

522
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,124
wide shot! wider!

523
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:14,766
go to the wide shot!

524
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:16,877
i want to see her goddamn legs!

525
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,152
why the fuck do you think i hired her?

526
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:26,689
stand up and give me a spin.

527
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:27,391
really?

528
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,534
yeah. it's a visual medium.

529
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,504
yeah. that's good. sit down.

530
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:41,292
i support the law, i do,
but mass deportations, come on.

531
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:45,008
that will never work, because of the
14th amendment, you want me to quote it?

532
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:47,046
if you are born in america -
you're an american.

533
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:48,168
period.

534
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:51,845
get me a demographically-friendly
hispanic woman on immigration.

535
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:55,184
she needs to be very
demographically-friendly.

536
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:56,993
okay. new girls up.

537
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,513
kayla?

538
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,938
hi, sir.

539
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,760
i was listening to
rush limbaugh this morning,

540
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,413
he said something kinda cool
about anthony weiner,

541
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:11,694
how he's an exhibitionist(imigração) in every aspect
of how he presents himself politically.

542
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:14,105
is she the best you can do?

543
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:16,822
bill shine asked us to give her a try.

544
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:20,324
okay, let's not lose focus,
back to immigration.

545
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:22,476
oh my god!

546
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,106
i can't get fired.

547
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:26,702
this is the only job
i have ever wanted.

548
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,035
i don't wanna be on tv,
i wanna be on fox.

549
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:34,243
my family... every day...
every holiday...

550
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,949
especially holidays,
they watch fox news.

551
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,225
we're like addicts.

552
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:40,458
fox is how we do church.

553
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,269
you know when they make
the corner logo turn?

554
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,952
'cause folks have box burned
into their tv screens. that's us.

555
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:47,668
kayla, you're not getting fired.

556
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,988
he cannot scale his anger,
he's a perpetual outrage machine.

557
00:27:50,988 --> 00:27:53,786
that's why crazies(loucos) love him.
no offense to your family.

558
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:55,916
you wanna do the folders?
no crying at fox.

559
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,344
no crying.

560
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:01,152
let me explain your mistake here.

561
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:05,010
rush is on hannity's team.
they are the competition,

562
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,683
their gop party hacks.
he thinks he's way ahead of him.

563
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:10,170
ceil full of drudge and break bar.
do not talk radio.

564
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,282
okay.

565
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,119
also stop worrying
if the story's legit.

566
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:15,677
and if you can't source it,
just go at "some are saying."

567
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:17,653
seriously?

568
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,521
you have to adopt the mentality
of an irish street cop.

569
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:24,557
the world is a bad place.
people are lazy morons.

570
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:27,805
minorities are criminals.
sex is sick but interesting.

571
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,212
ask yourself what would scare
my grandmother,

572
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:32,276
or piss off my grandfather -

573
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:33,651
and that's a fox story.

574
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:35,081
are you writing this down?

575
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:35,978
makes so much sense.

576
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:38,559
frighten to the lay.

577
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,796
when you're starting a story
you need to start with a clear villain.

578
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,033
liberal judge, pinhead(escrúpulos) mayor,
vermont, hollywood.

579
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:51,585
conservatives wanna conserve.

580
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:54,844
you're the last defense against

581
00:28:55,248 --> 00:29:00,956
jesus-hating, trans-loving,
clinton-controlled armageddon, baby.

582
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,828
come on.

583
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,850
you do believe some of that, right?

584
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:08,525
yeah.

585
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,938
it's quite a face you have.

586
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:21,222
really? thank you.

587
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,523
- i'm drunk.
- i'm drunk as well.

588
00:29:31,023 --> 00:29:34,976
you have a hillary poster
in your house?

589
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:37,432
i guess i do.

590
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:42,933
okay. my parents would be horrified
if i went home with a democrat.

591
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,271
the lesbianism, however?

592
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,315
i'm not a lesbian.

593
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:51,093
i'm not a democrat.

594
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:54,989
i just have two giant
hillary posters in my kitchen.

595
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,155
as a joke though, right?

596
00:29:58,155 --> 00:30:01,077
no, that's who i'd like
to be the president.

597
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:03,067
are you serious?

598
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,740
i'm a closeted(negações) democrat.

599
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:07,794
at fox news?

600
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,236
i thought that you knew that.

601
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:11,906
no. i didn't know that.
does anyone know that?

602
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:14,363
can you not tell?
you can't tell anyone.

603
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,302
- of course, i won't tell.
- i'm so serious.

604
00:30:16,706 --> 00:30:18,077
can i ask something?

605
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,450
why do you work at fox?

606
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,809
when you can work at
msnbc or something.

607
00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:30,528
i think, i like, thrive
in toxic environments.

608
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,219
i never know
if you're kidding or not.

609
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,747
i am kidding. i applied
everywhere and...

610
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,951
i got a job at fox.

611
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:42,658
and i keep applying the other places,
and they keep not taking me

612
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:44,621
because i work at fox.

613
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,674
oh my gosh.

614
00:30:49,436 --> 00:30:53,035
it's okay. one day
i'm gonna be free.

615
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,318
what? it's not that bad.

616
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:56,952
if you're gay, it's pretty bad.

617
00:30:57,807 --> 00:30:59,911
yeah, you don't be gay at fox.

618
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:04,287
you work for bill o'reilly,
you have a hillary poster?

619
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:07,259
you do know he likes to call up
female producers(produtores) and wack off, right?

620
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:08,446
bill?

621
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:09,892
yes, bill.

622
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:11,017
no.

623
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,100
you haven't heard about
andrea mackris lawsuit?

624
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,120
- no.
- oh my god.

625
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,160
this should be in a welcome packing.

626
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,231
she was one of the
associate producers.

627
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,092
he took her, and only her, to the
republican national convention.

628
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,740
called her up at 11 p.m.

629
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:27,713
touching himself, and telling her
what he wanted to do to her

630
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:29,449
with the old falafel.

631
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:31,840
are you kidding?

632
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,063
it's on the internet,
and then...

633
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:37,284
quote, "using a vibrator(vibrador) upon himself."

634
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:41,088
like he brought a vibrator
from home to the convention?

635
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:44,202
yes, well, you have to bring a vibrator
from home to the convention.

636
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:49,624
the question is, what does a man
do with a vibrator?

637
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,555
do you place it alongside the shaft?

638
00:31:57,901 --> 00:31:59,363
i don't wanna hear that.

639
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:02,006
"fucking die, bitch."

640
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,723
"if i see you, you better run."

641
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,648
"i wouldn't be sleeping
too soundly if i were you."

642
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,561
trump's lit the torches.

643
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,570
you're getting security tonight.

644
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,942
all i want is for this
to go away, roger.

645
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:20,764
look, every general in history
has gone into battle feeling the same.

646
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,122
fine.

647
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:30,029
i'll read a statement, at the top
saying: "yes, trump(trunfo) is attacking me."

648
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:33,492
but i'm not going to respond,
any defense will come from you.

649
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,794
not right now.

650
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:42,795
you set a record on viewer(visualizador) email.

651
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,933
let me guess. none of it on my side.

652
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:47,342
no.

653
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,268
our audience loves trump.

654
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,702
and the hell of a lot more
than the murdochs realize.

655
00:32:52,934 --> 00:32:55,012
more than trump(trunfo) knows.

656
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:57,137
he's tweeting "we made peace."

657
00:32:57,295 --> 00:32:59,609
he'll come on 'fox & friends' tomorrow.

658
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:01,730
he needs us. we need him.

659
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,875
it's got nothing to do with you.

660
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:10,026
all right. it's late.
i have dogs to feed.

661
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,287
just to be clear.

662
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,209
i will not be kissing
trump's ass at nine o'clock.

663
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,673
we fight tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

664
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,970
let me see that
statement again, bill.

665
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:52,951
you may have heard
there was a dust up involving

666
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:55,859
yours truly and presidential
contender donald...

667
00:33:57,597 --> 00:33:59,237
how are you doing, megyn?

668
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,022
hanging in there.

669
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:05,907
give him hell, megyn.

670
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,743
we go live in

671
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:17,774
five... four... three... two...

672
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:21,370
i just got back from a weekend at the beach
with my husband and my three kids.

673
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,554
did anything happen
in the news while i was gone?

674
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,643
you may have heard there was
a dust up involving yours truly

675
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:28,678
and presidential(presidencial) contender
donald trump.

676
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:30,007
mr. trump(trunfo) was upset
with a question i asked...

677
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:34,284
cute baby.

678
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:37,567
i gotta say i can't stand your show.

679
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:43,130
you guys at fox, you're doing
terrible things to our country.

680
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:46,000
i hope that makes you feel better.

681
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:51,332
how you treat people you disagree with
says everything about you.

682
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,793
<i>jesus was a white man, too.</i>

683
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,404
<i>he was a historical figure,
that's a verifiable(jabba) fact,</i>

684
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:07,226
<i>as is santa, i just want the kids
watching to know that.</i>

685
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:11,616
<i>but my point is, how do you just revise it,
and change santa from white to black?</i>

686
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:14,818
oh, hi.

687
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:19,093
wow, nice dress.

688
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:22,201
i hope you don't wear that
to sunday service.

689
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:26,391
please, i have church jeans,
so i can hood a latte on my knee.

690
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,863
oh my god, kayla.
did you see this?

691
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:32,410
what?

692
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:37,669
i'm a creep.

693
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:40,449
that is gross.

694
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,105
are you crazy?

695
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:51,254
that's my friend from college.

696
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:54,063
i'm just looking out for you.

697
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:55,604
who are you stalking?

698
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,242
no one.

699
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,610
i feel for you.

700
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,556
that show.

701
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,762
his bark is worse than his bite.

702
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:22,085
i work for roger, we have
two, three and four donut days.

703
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,527
sugar does make everybody crazy.

704
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:28,992
no, these aren't donuts he eats,
they're donuts he throws at somebody.

705
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,568
no, he's a pussycat.

706
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:37,643
come say hi, we're always looking
for a new talent.

707
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:39,640
really?

708
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:42,606
now?

709
00:36:43,957 --> 00:36:45,012
sure.

710
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:52,544
that's roger's private elevator.

711
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:54,784
hang on a sec.

712
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,414
hello.

713
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:09,527
have a seat.

714
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,084
thank you.

715
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,466
liberals don't get megyn.

716
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:18,072
she's a star, not because
she thinks santa's white.

717
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:19,469
but because she'll say it.

718
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:20,464
that's right.

719
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:24,213
if you have courage in the spotlight,
it's powerful to watch.

720
00:37:24,213 --> 00:37:26,491
and she went up 30% that quarter.

721
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,226
and rather that too.

722
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:32,232
all audience is want is authenticity.

723
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,154
for two hundred years,
santa is a fat white guy.

724
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:37,827
they think santa,
that's what they see.

725
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:39,726
you wanna change that? fine.

726
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,194
let's discuss it without
you calling my people racist.

727
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,236
exactly.

728
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:46,953
a liberal is somebody
who wants to live in a future

729
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:51,547
that he is too lazy, or too arrogant
to actually create.

730
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:54,702
in my family, santa's always been white.

731
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:58,440
and according to my grandaddy, a communist.

732
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:02,232
so, that's my family.

733
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:08,996
so, what can i do for you, kayla?
why did you drop by to see me?

734
00:38:09,507 --> 00:38:10,809
the thing is, sir.

735
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:15,430
i actually started on air during college
in central florida. weather.

736
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:20,977
i wanna convince you
that that is where i belong, mr. ailes.

737
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:24,008
i think i'd be freakin' phenomenal
on your network.

738
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:29,095
it's mr. murdoch's air.
but i did create it.

739
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,675
i do run it.

740
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,117
you have a pretty face.

741
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,419
stand up and give me a twirl.

742
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:39,539
now?

743
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:42,381
yeah, just a quick spin.

744
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:43,885
sure.

745
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:55,430
that's very good.

746
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:01,182
pull your dress up
and let me see your legs.

747
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:17,109
it's a visual medium, kayla.

748
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,848
come on.

749
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:29,959
higher.

750
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:47,568
higher.

751
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:12,119
that's fine, kayla.

752
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,364
why don't you sit down.

753
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,108
thank you.

754
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:32,790
you have a great body.

755
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,526
thank you.

756
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,332
mr. ailes. i'd appreciated if

757
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:45,391
you didn't mention...

758
00:40:45,391 --> 00:40:47,207
no, of course.

759
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:50,360
i'm here to help my employees,
not to hurt them.

760
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:57,563
anything that happens here, in this room,
is strictly between you and me.

761
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,438
okay.

762
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:00,801
of course, it cuts both ways.

763
00:41:01,738 --> 00:41:06,142
i'm discreet, but unforgiving.

764
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:21,753
success in broadcast television
is hard, it's arbitrary.

765
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:25,055
this is the most competitive
industry on earth.

766
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,145
you understand what i'm saying?

767
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,196
we could work together.

768
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:38,497
i can pluck you out and move you
all the way to the front of the line.

769
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:42,601
but i want something in return.

770
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,441
you know what that is, kayla?

771
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,458
loyalty.

772
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:58,323
i need to know that you're loyal.

773
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:04,407
i need you to find a way to prove it.

774
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:08,530
you think about that, all right?

775
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,508
so, we'll talk again.

776
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:19,946
faye can show you the way out.

777
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,924
thank you, sir.

778
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:46,109
jess. jess.

779
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,921
something really weird just happened.

780
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:58,703
i just went to say hi to...

781
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:00,014
i just... i met...

782
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,780
i was invited to meet roger.

783
00:43:04,822 --> 00:43:06,262
i mean nothing...

784
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:08,895
nothing happened.

785
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:10,601
kayla.

786
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:15,783
it's actually better for you
if you don't involve me in this.

787
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:20,044
'cause they know the workarounds.

788
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,893
i'm sorry.

789
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:25,099
okay.

790
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:27,225
this place is crazy.

791
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:39,206
no trump! no kkk!
no fascist usa!

792
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,038
jesus. okay, we're here.

793
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:44,220
<i>his assistant's name is rona.
the security guard is keith.</i>

794
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:45,537
got it.

795
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:48,018
gil, last words?

796
00:43:48,163 --> 00:43:51,453
<i>yeah, don't piss him off.
i need this job. good luck.</i>

797
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:53,648
i'll be waiting right here, okay?

798
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:12,311
<i>during the day, if i'm in the office,
i have a number of people</i>

799
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:14,643
<i>that i'll just call out a tweet to.
it's always my right.</i>

800
00:44:14,743 --> 00:44:16,973
<i>you probably had some pretty nasty
tweets sent your way,</i>

801
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:18,945
<i>i don't want that to happen
but my fans...</i>

802
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:21,842
<i>but you retweet some of those.
it's not just the fans.</i>

803
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:23,780
<i>but not the more nasty ones.</i>

804
00:44:23,763 --> 00:44:26,200
<i>you would be amazed
with the ones i don't retweet.</i>

805
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,464
<i>bimbo?</i>

806
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:31,051
<i>well, there was a retweet, yeah.
did i say that?</i>

807
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,193
<i>many times.</i>

808
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:34,156
<i>okay, excuse me.</i>

809
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,278
<i>not the most horrible thing…</i>

810
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:40,816
<i>over your life megyn, you've been called
a lot worse. is that right?</i>

811
00:44:40,816 --> 00:44:42,332
that's enough.

812
00:44:43,535 --> 00:44:45,558
well, what do you think?

813
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:49,069
i think you're too solicitous.

814
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:50,518
thank you.

815
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:53,607
with these ones i can
handle it straight positive.

816
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:58,253
i'm sorry, he attacks you
for a year straight.

817
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,630
and you let him off
with a fucking "oops."

818
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,693
what? i don't let him off.
i confront him.

819
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,885
i used donald trump.

820
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:08,721
honey, you absolved(artistas) him.

821
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:11,749
dough, there are internal
political pressures in play here...

822
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:13,841
yeah, i bet. i get it, gil.

823
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,520
can we have a second, guys? please?

824
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:22,979
i'm not trying to be critical, i just...

825
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:25,123
well, you are!
i made this go away.

826
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:28,277
i stopped his harassing(ivana) bullshit for us.

827
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:30,710
i've never asked you to do that.

828
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,532
he is going to be the
republican candidate for president.

829
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:35,490
i'm a news anchor,
i need access to him.

830
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,008
you need access?
at what fucking price?

831
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:40,248
at what price?
the price of our apartment.

832
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,022
my salary.

833
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:45,157
that pays our fucking bills!

834
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,483
look, for the record...

835
00:45:55,483 --> 00:45:58,025
no! it's been a shitty year!

836
00:45:59,262 --> 00:46:02,964
really fucking shitty year,
and i'm allowed to won it over!

837
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:06,105
you are.

838
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:08,900
fuck.

839
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,083
do we really need ar-15s
to be able to hunt deer?

840
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,707
protect our families?

841
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:18,072
i'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

842
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,985
some of these mass shootings would've been
less deadly if that'd been the case.

843
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:24,948
but i'm also with the majority today.

844
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:28,819
taking a stand against
semi-automatic assault weapons,

845
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,805
which brings us back
to the question of the day.

846
00:46:30,945 --> 00:46:34,925
<font color="#ffff00">should congress reinstate
the assault weapons ban?</font>

847
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:39,535
<font color="#ffff00">i know a lot of you
don't agree with me, that's fine.</font>

848
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,267
<font color="#ffff00">eighty nine percent
of you say "no."</font>

849
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,904
and that what makes america great.

850
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,424
great.

851
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:55,025
the second floor wants to see you.

852
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:57,495
- now?
- yeah.

853
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:03,173
this is kayla.

854
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:06,289
hi.

855
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:15,294
yeah, i'll come right up then.

856
00:48:24,664 --> 00:48:26,213
ladies.

857
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:28,292
hey.

858
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,406
hot in here.

859
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,228
gretchen.

860
00:49:20,384 --> 00:49:21,303
how are you?

861
00:49:21,303 --> 00:49:23,720
okay. i miss our lunches.

862
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,075
roger wants to see me?

863
00:49:28,663 --> 00:49:31,153
no, i think it was dianne.

864
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:33,708
i just saw her in with bill.

865
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:36,586
all right. wow.

866
00:49:39,139 --> 00:49:40,908
see you, ladies, later then.

867
00:49:40,908 --> 00:49:42,142
bye.

868
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:44,634
roger's ready for you, kayla.

869
00:49:45,957 --> 00:49:47,842
okay.

870
00:49:56,477 --> 00:49:57,880
never stops.

871
00:49:58,024 --> 00:50:01,539
gretchen, you've been such
an instrumental part of the fox family.

872
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:03,206
absolutely.

873
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:06,362
we just wanted to tell you
that we appreciated the work...

874
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:08,726
he firing me, isn't he?

875
00:50:10,879 --> 00:50:12,744
yes.

876
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,209
you wanna tell me why?

877
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:28,370
<i>what could they say?</i>

878
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:31,223
<i>you're sexy, but you're too much work.</i>

879
00:50:31,544 --> 00:50:33,174
<i>you're a men hater.</i>

880
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:36,460
<i>to get ahead you gotta
give a little head.</i>

881
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:44,247
good luck, ms. carlson.

882
00:50:45,071 --> 00:50:46,998
<i>do you know why
we dress soldiers the same?</i>

883
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:49,217
<i>so everybody knows
they're replaceable.</i>

884
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:54,562
<i>i refuse to be replaceable.</i>

885
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:00,446
i finally did it. i'm out.

886
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:01,685
did they give you a cause?

887
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:03,146
- no.
- good.

888
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,852
ready to go to war?

889
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:07,560
oh yeah! i'm ready.

890
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:23,926
murdoch here.

891
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:25,749
funny. have you seen the lawsuit?

892
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,474
which lawsuit?

893
00:51:30,876 --> 00:51:32,163
i'm not stopping.

894
00:51:32,163 --> 00:51:35,875
roger is being sued(jess) for sexual
harassment by gretchen carlson.

895
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:39,268
where's dad?

896
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:40,936
paris.

897
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:45,742
yeah?

898
00:51:45,742 --> 00:51:47,529
i have your father's
attorney for you.

899
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:49,391
thank you.

900
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:53,598
morning, this employee
has sued(jess) roger personally.

901
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:57,419
he doesn't know who she is.

902
00:51:58,313 --> 00:52:00,298
are you familiar with ms. carlson?

903
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:02,116
until two hours ago
i've never heard about her.

904
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:05,364
more importantly, no one
heard from her after she was fired.

905
00:52:05,364 --> 00:52:07,561
wait, not even
to negotiate a severance?

906
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:11,106
no, and that suggests she knew
it was coming and she had a plan.

907
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,860
as news corp. attorney,
i recommend you conduct

908
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,517
an internal investigation
into roger's behavior.

909
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:18,451
i know you two have had
issues with him.

910
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:22,596
<font color="#ffff00">i need everyone's attention!
listen up people!</font>

911
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,484
<font color="#ffff00">a post employee has received
a package of anthrax, that's just above us.</font>

912
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,478
close the goddamn vents!

913
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:30,700
all of them, right now!

914
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,439
roger.

915
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,690
nobody opens the mail!

916
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,459
roger.

917
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:34,779
we're under attack! don't touch...

918
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,281
roger!

919
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:38,817
everything upstairs is under control.

920
00:52:39,277 --> 00:52:40,950
you need to calm down.

921
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,932
do not give orders in my newsroom!

922
00:52:44,247 --> 00:52:47,442
if it was yours, you'd own it.

923
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:52,463
it's okay everyone,
everything's gonna be fine.

924
00:52:52,463 --> 00:52:54,789
go back to work. thank you.

925
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,205
yeah, let's look into her claims.

926
00:53:01,205 --> 00:53:03,095
done.

927
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:20,775
hi.

928
00:53:21,442 --> 00:53:23,630
oh my god. it's anchor(âncora) barbie.

929
00:53:24,836 --> 00:53:27,083
i'm testing for a fox business.

930
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,833
holy fucking christ!

931
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:36,390
i'll call you right back.

932
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,100
pull up 'the new york times' right now.

933
00:53:56,697 --> 00:54:00,398
josh. get me a nice shot
for main street, no pre-seasoning.

934
00:54:00,464 --> 00:54:01,804
right.

935
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:05,397
when you're photographing
for my paper, don't wear a hoodie.

936
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:07,766
okay.

937
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:09,293
hoodies are creepy.

938
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:12,394
thank you. thank you.

939
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,145
what is that?

940
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:22,517
just grocery store sushi.

941
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:27,066
sushi is not liberal food.

942
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:30,335
i didn't say that it was.

943
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:35,294
hi, love.

944
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:37,874
go home. right now.
don't talk to anybody.

945
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,755

00:54:42,797 --> 00:54:43,401

yeah.

959
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,518
beth, i just talked to the rep.
it's an online publication.

960
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:50,288
i say how sad it is.
we've got this woman

961
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:54,289
making these complaints,
when there are real victims out there.

962
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:55,090
i know roger.

963
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:58,871
i told 'people' magazine we've been
in the office alone a lot over 15 years.

964
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:00,708
i've never seen anything
like what i'm reading now.

965
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:03,471
i say i don't even think gretchen carlson
has a friend in the building.

966
00:56:03,471 --> 00:56:04,976
i know roger, someone
would've told me.

967
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:06,515
they gonna quote me on that.

968
00:56:06,515 --> 00:56:07,322
not a ring of truth.

969
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:10,556
maria bartiromo send
variety of stock chart.

970
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:11,964
- hey, we're up.
- woohoo.

971
00:56:11,964 --> 00:56:14,620
hannity tweeted: "i talked to hundreds
of women at fox this week"

972
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,517
both on air and off,
they say it all bs."

973
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:18,587
brit hume(hume msnbc) too.

974
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:19,401
brit?

975
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:23,266
"why didn't gretchen quit and sue,
instead of suing(processamento) only after she got fired?"

976
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:24,376
why didn't she complain?

977
00:56:24,376 --> 00:56:25,971
"why didn't she complain?" - really?

978
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:27,600
he means the anonymous hotline.

979
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,994
- there's a hotline?
- yeah.

980
00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:32,355
i did the harassment(assédio) seminar twice.
i never heard about a hotline.

981
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,497
because it's bullshit.

982
00:56:33,497 --> 00:56:36,448
they have a contractual(contratual) right
to monitor our communications.

983
00:56:36,448 --> 00:56:39,840
a hotline(linha direta) in this building is like
a complaint box in occupied paris.

984
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:42,713
it's like we're telling women,

985
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:47,571
go on, speak up for yourself, just know,
the entire network is with roger.

986
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:50,329
no one will believe you.
they'll call you a liar.

987
00:56:50,934 --> 00:56:53,442
and as of you career,
you want assignments and air time?

988
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,215
go ahead, call the paranoid man
who decides you salary,

989
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,539
a pervert, and do that on a fucking
anonymous hotline(linha direta) he controls

990
00:56:59,656 --> 00:57:02,489
on a phone he has
a contractual(contratual) right to record.

991
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:05,018
jesus fucking christ!
do you think women are idiots?

992
00:57:05,018 --> 00:57:06,836
it's like if somebody striped
you naked and they want you

993
00:57:06,836 --> 00:57:09,697
to walk through this office
just to fucking prove it.

994
00:57:10,405 --> 00:57:12,041
okay.

995
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,906
can i see you for a minute?

996
00:57:24,423 --> 00:57:25,965
what the fuck was that?

997
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,048
i don't know, but i liked it.

998
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:38,333
i won't call you a feminist, but,
say, there's a spectrum, you are...

999
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,169
roger harassed(assediado) me.

1000
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:44,253
ten years ago.

1001
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,241
i had turned down a law firm partnership
for an entry-level job here at fox.

1002
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,252
roger would call me up to new york,
to dingle prospects.

1003
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,488
i wanted his help.

1004
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,586
did you...

1005
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:05,843
do anything?

1006
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:07,584
no.

1007
00:58:08,657 --> 00:58:10,531
will you talk?

1008
00:58:12,852 --> 00:58:14,610
- megyn?
- i don't know.

1009
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,311
i don't know.

1010
00:58:18,944 --> 00:58:21,205
i mean, going on the record...

1011
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:23,718
jesus.

1012
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:27,459
that's basically admitting
you're the weak one in the herd.

1013
00:58:27,459 --> 00:58:30,488
no, it's admitting(horton) you're the hot one.

1014
00:58:30,488 --> 00:58:32,115
it has nothing to do with that, gil.

1015
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:33,907
- say, women?
- oh my god.

1016
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:36,823
there is a reason certain women
came to fend roger.

1017
00:58:36,823 --> 00:58:41,577
if i report this, and it leaks, it will
follow me for the rest of my career.

1018
00:58:41,827 --> 00:58:43,503
i don't wanna be defined
by roger's bullshit.

1019
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:46,899
i refuse to be a fucking
poster-girl for sexual harassment.

1020
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,341
he can't still
be doing that crap, right?

1021
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:51,635
i mean the man is a walker.

1022
00:58:52,106 --> 00:58:54,235
- viagra?
- gil!

1023
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:58,189
help me here, please.

1024
00:58:58,189 --> 00:59:00,131
how do i play this?

1025
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,344
you only ask when you already know.

1026
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:10,409
if i learned anything this year,
it's to not get sucked into a fight

1027
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:13,431
with someone who has better reason
to be in it than you do.

1028
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:15,781
okay.

1029
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:18,720
okay.

1030
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:22,685
so, what is it you wanna do?

1031
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:25,462
for right now nothing.

1032
00:59:25,618 --> 00:59:27,727
- good.
- good.

1033
00:59:49,812 --> 00:59:51,102
there she is.

1034
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:52,891
roger.

1035
00:59:52,891 --> 00:59:55,005
hello, my sweetheart.

1036
00:59:58,013 --> 00:59:59,339
sit. sit.

1037
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,153
you've met mayor giuliani before.

1038
01:00:02,153 --> 01:00:03,310
of course.

1039
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:07,281
there's an internal investigation,
but i'm not gonna wait for it to clear me.

1040
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:10,068
the republican(republicano) convention
in less than two weeks away.

1041
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:12,310
this is bullshit. i'm gonna fight that.

1042
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,002
the charges are absurd.

1043
01:00:14,002 --> 01:00:18,074
i met roger, i love that they'd just given
me a chance to repay you

1044
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:20,061
from when i was in intensive care.

1045
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:23,073
roger called my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks.

1046
01:00:23,322 --> 01:00:25,944
he told them he'd put me on air
live from their hospital bed

1047
01:00:25,944 --> 01:00:28,663
if they didn't fix every stitch
of damage done.

1048
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,229
but i'm also here as someone
who has dealt with this issue for years,

1049
01:00:33,377 --> 01:00:35,741
years on the side of women.

1050
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:39,292
i don't wanna see
sexual violence trivialized.

1051
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:42,801
i don't wanna see it become
some damn political football.

1052
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:46,469
in that spirit i need to ask,

1053
01:00:46,637 --> 01:00:51,721
will an investigation find
anything <i>uncomfortable</i>?

1054
01:00:54,604 --> 01:00:56,230
define <i>uncomfortable</i>.

1055
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:01,399
roger, quote: "i think you i should've had
a sexual relationship a long time ago",

1056
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:04,597
and then you'd be good and better
and i'd be good and better."

1057
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:07,040
- did you say that?
- no, i'm not a fool.

1058
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,435
you missed your chance
for me to harass(molestar) you? come on.

1059
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:12,224
i think the law give it solicitous.

1060
01:01:12,224 --> 01:01:15,586
telling a woman she was
fuckable a long time ago.

1061
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:17,293
who the hell thinks that worse?

1062
01:01:17,293 --> 01:01:18,769
why is she suing, roger?

1063
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:23,517
gretchen is a very competitive woman,
facing a severe likability(semelhança) issue,

1064
01:01:24,672 --> 01:01:28,020
one, that i shielded her from for years.

1065
01:01:28,213 --> 01:01:30,063
her career is over, i'm afraid.

1066
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:33,270
and she can't take a joke.
roger is very salty.

1067
01:01:33,432 --> 01:01:37,506
i find him amusing.
it's my fault, i encourage it.

1068
01:01:37,506 --> 01:01:42,786
james murdoch could be behind this,
his wife openly supports hillary.

1069
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:44,423
and it could go deeper.

1070
01:01:44,598 --> 01:01:48,535
i have good reason to believe that
inside the obama white house

1071
01:01:48,535 --> 01:01:52,353
there've been discussions,
on what level i do not know,

1072
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,615
of having me killed.

1073
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:47,589
oh jesus.

1074
01:02:49,985 --> 01:02:50,854
hi there.

1075
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,075
hey.

1076
01:02:53,456 --> 01:02:55,132
roger needs you.

1077
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:57,966
your silence is being noticed.

1078
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:02,968
the whole point of an investigation
is to find the truth, jeanine.

1079
01:03:02,968 --> 01:03:05,492
until that happens
i don't have a lot to say.

1080
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:08,738
if this charge sticks,
the working assumption would be

1081
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:14,366
<i>every woman</i> at fox bent down
on her knees, even you.

1082
01:03:14,696 --> 01:03:18,027
if we sweep this thing under the rug,
jeanine, and it happen again.

1083
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:23,462
under title seven fox would be liable
for compensatory(compensatório) and punitive damages,

1084
01:03:23,462 --> 01:03:25,481
that could be hundreds of millions.

1085
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:28,187
let's worry about the law
before we do the pr, okay?

1086
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:31,355
does roger want us? yes.

1087
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:33,650
he's a man.

1088
01:03:34,242 --> 01:03:37,474
he also gave us time,
he gave us opportunity.

1089
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:40,505
we benefit from that kind of attention.

1090
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:44,944
i mean, jeanine pirro?

1091
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:47,652
she's like the founding member
of 'team roger'.

1092
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:49,970
- you're not answering your phone.
- i know. i'm holding it.

1093
01:03:50,804 --> 01:03:52,255
everybody is still looking for you.

1094
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:55,234
where were any of these people
to defend me from trump?

1095
01:03:55,914 --> 01:03:57,641
bill shine told them not to.

1096
01:03:57,641 --> 01:03:59,164
what the fuck?!

1097
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:00,852
our boss.

1098
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,522
why are you guys in the hall?

1099
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:06,127
i got a call from roger's lawyers,
saying, to quote: "relax."

1100
01:04:06,282 --> 01:04:09,824
they're convincing rupert to limit
the investigation to gretchen and her team.

1101
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:11,719
that's only five or six women.

1102
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:14,402
are you gonna let that happen?

1103
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,227
i like roger, i do.

1104
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,442
i know.

1105
01:04:25,442 --> 01:04:28,020
even if he can be
controlling and vindictive.

1106
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:30,427
those sins aren't
really the problem, meg.

1107
01:04:30,564 --> 01:04:34,401
there are hundreds of stories
of roger paying an employee's rehab,

1108
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:36,957
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll.

1109
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,090
you remember when chuck came out?

1110
01:04:39,568 --> 01:04:40,827
all roger said was:

1111
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:42,378
"i don't care where you put your paper,

1112
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,158
as long as you don't tell me
where to put mine."

1113
01:04:44,158 --> 01:04:46,481
again, not the most redeeming...

1114
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:50,161
he promoted me.
he's looked past the rejection.

1115
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:53,205
he looked past the risk
of this exact conversation.

1116
01:04:53,365 --> 01:04:56,083
he handed me the power to hurt him.

1117
01:05:24,952 --> 01:05:25,821
morning.

1118
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,093
hi, megyn.

1119
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:29,864
we need to get gerson zweifach
on the phone.

1120
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,352
gerson, i'm calling from roger.

1121
01:05:32,352 --> 01:05:34,298
he wants me to be a part
of your investigation.

1122
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:36,529
we've decided on an outside firm.

1123
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:37,461
but why?

1124
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:39,752
gerson, we can handle this ourselves.

1125
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:41,502
i'm asking paul weiss.

1126
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:42,757
paul weiss?

1127
01:05:42,757 --> 01:05:45,868
you tell him that i can
actively participate.

1128
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:49,768
mr. giuliani, you're an old friend
of roger, you've married them.

1129
01:05:49,806 --> 01:05:53,604
sharing information with you will remove
the cloak of attorney-client privilege

1130
01:05:53,604 --> 01:05:57,833
making a testimony of any woman
who comes forward subject to discovery.

1131
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,979
i understand, you give me a waver.

1132
01:05:59,979 --> 01:06:04,396
i will not structure this investigation
so roger isn't perceived of as its target.

1133
01:06:04,396 --> 01:06:06,294
you wanna glue a guilty?

1134
01:06:06,734 --> 01:06:08,674
that depends on what we find.

1135
01:06:12,075 --> 01:06:14,112
do you know a reporter gabe sherman?

1136
01:06:14,397 --> 01:06:15,306
no.

1137
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:16,641
you're about to.

1138
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:19,645
he's found six women who claim
roger ailes harassed(assediado) them.

1139
01:06:19,824 --> 01:06:22,995
all from before
roger founded fox news.

1140
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:27,973
<i>this was years ago, he said
he would put me on the show,</i>

1141
01:06:27,973 --> 01:06:30,683
<i>but i had to go to bed
with him, and i just said:</i>

1142
01:06:30,683 --> 01:06:33,022
<i>"yeah, right, you and who else?"</i>

1143
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:37,569
<i>and he said: "just me and a few
of my preferred friends."</i>

1144
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:42,730
<i>i came in and he closed the door,
turned and kissed me</i>

1145
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,873
<i>like i was his girlfriend,
like he knew it was coming.</i>

1146
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:47,819
<i>he grabbed my tits, and he said:</i>

1147
01:06:47,819 --> 01:06:51,482
<i>"look, no girl gets a job here
unless they're cooperative."</i>

1148
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,230
<i>if you wanna make it in new york city
in a tv business,</i>

1149
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,918
<i>you'll gonna have to fuck me,
and you'll gonna have to do that</i>

1150
01:06:57,918 --> 01:07:00,044
<i>with anyone i tell you to.</i>

1151
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:04,047
<i>he finishes the test,
which is me pretending to cook,</i>

1152
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:07,864
<i>then he pulls out a garter(liga) belt
and stockings, and says: "put these on."</i>

1153
01:07:07,864 --> 01:07:11,043
<i>so, yeah, i put them on.</i>

1154
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:14,962
<i>"and he said:" you know,
i can really help you,</i>

1155
01:07:14,962 --> 01:07:19,020
<i>but if you wanna play with the big boys
you'll have to lay with the big boys."</i>

1156
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,451
<i>it was very transactional.</i>

1157
01:07:22,926 --> 01:07:27,890
<i>it was quiet. he stared at me.
he undid(candidatos) his pants</i>

1158
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:32,364
<i>and took out his penis, very gingerly.</i>

1159
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:36,558
<i>i had never seen one, i was scared.</i>

1160
01:07:37,122 --> 01:07:41,661
<i>and he said: "kiss it." i was 16.</i>

1161
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:47,823
<i>former anchor(âncora) gretchen carlson filing
a sexual harassment(assédio) lawsuit</i>

1162
01:07:47,823 --> 01:07:50,155
<i>against fox news chief roger ailes.</i>

1163
01:07:50,155 --> 01:07:53,280
<i>more women are coming forward.
ailes is denying the allegations...</i>

1164
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:56,347
<i>the accusations against roger ailes...</i>

1165
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,549
i have never run
a goddamn dairy queen.

1166
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:01,084
you don't get to go
and get whatever you want.

1167
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:07,198
everybody on my shows knows the meaning
of decency, and i do mean everybody.

1168
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:10,694
a tv outfit needs tough,
confident women.

1169
01:08:10,694 --> 01:08:13,056
do i push them? you bet your ass i do!

1170
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:16,504
but have i ever demanded sex
during a casting(demotion) session?

1171
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:19,345
have i offered extra pay for blowjobs?

1172
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:22,671
give me a goddamn break!
why the hell would i do that?!

1173
01:08:23,372 --> 01:08:26,277
you know the look in a woman's eye
when she's interested?

1174
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,966
walk into casting, back then,
as the decider, there was a look they gave.

1175
01:08:32,618 --> 01:08:34,856
i did not always looked like this.

1176
01:08:34,863 --> 01:08:38,830
i never had to harass(molestar) anybody, and it's
fucking offensive to say that i did!

1177
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,411
they're trying to change history,
for their families.

1178
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:44,358
some of them probably
don't even remember what happened.

1179
01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:47,583
that's gracious of you, beth.

1180
01:08:50,095 --> 01:08:55,514
but this is political, i defy you
defying any evidence

1181
01:08:55,514 --> 01:08:58,304
that a single part of what
these women are saying is true.

1182
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,625
get ready. more will come.

1183
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:03,621
we need to let rupert know
what it means if i lose.

1184
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:06,921
gretchen carlson could kill fox news!

1185
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:09,032
this is a fight for your jobs!

1186
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:11,568
if i go you go!

1187
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:16,522
if you'd ask me what type
of sexual fetish roger ailes had,

1188
01:09:16,522 --> 01:09:19,476
i never would've come up with garter
belts, but it's fucking perfect.

1189
01:09:19,476 --> 01:09:21,442
their stories are so similar.

1190
01:09:21,442 --> 01:09:24,908
that doesn't prove much. sherman met
them all through gretchen's lawyer.

1191
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:26,711
they could've been coached.

1192
01:09:27,155 --> 01:09:28,961
blowjob thing feels real to me.

1193
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,836
does roger seem like a guy
who would get off

1194
01:09:30,836 --> 01:09:32,948
in that particular power dynamic - yes.

1195
01:09:33,197 --> 01:09:36,748
the guy who maybe thinks
world doesn't really count - maybe.

1196
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:39,492
the guy who has reasons
to prefer a sex act

1197
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:42,503
that lets him keep
his clothes on - sure.

1198
01:09:43,282 --> 01:09:45,345
but it still doesn't make it true.

1199
01:09:46,533 --> 01:09:50,472
if true, these incidents
all happen before fox started.

1200
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:53,169
- should that matter?
- no.

1201
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:54,952
yes.

1202
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:02,786
i talked to gerson zweifach.

1203
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:03,925
and?

1204
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:07,540
he asked me to encourage women
who have claims to come forward.

1205
01:10:07,717 --> 01:10:11,187
you remember what happened last time
you got between rupert and roger?

1206
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:14,817
before i speak out,

1207
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:18,068
i need to know if this happened
to other women in fox.

1208
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,756
you understand that?

1209
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,006
is this the one where
you really wanna know?

1210
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:30,323
or you wanna look like
you really wanna know, but don't?

1211
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:33,702
i really wanna know.

1212
01:10:36,271 --> 01:10:38,584
i'm not always like that.

1213
01:10:39,165 --> 01:10:42,510
no one around here believes
roger would wanna harass(molestar) gretchen.

1214
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,758
i will send you some
of her soapy(admitindo) notes to roger.

1215
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:50,516
"last night sandra filled in for megyn,
why not me [smiley face]?"

1216
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:52,971
who sends a harasser(assediador) a smiley(risonho) face?

1217
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:55,568
- martin.
- hey, nancy.

1218
01:10:55,568 --> 01:10:57,969
- thanks for coming.
- of course.

1219
01:10:57,969 --> 01:10:59,550
hi, nancy, coffee?

1220
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:01,561
thank you.

1221
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:05,781
so, what do you got?

1222
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:10,920
no one from fox has come forward.

1223
01:11:11,072 --> 01:11:12,407
no one?

1224
01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:14,617
rudi bakhtiar.

1225
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:17,892
but no one who's still there?

1226
01:11:17,892 --> 01:11:20,490
it's been nothing but praise for roger.

1227
01:11:20,631 --> 01:11:24,396
except for megyn kelly.
she's been unusually silent.

1228
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:27,802
something must've happened
to megyn in the past with roger.

1229
01:11:27,802 --> 01:11:30,465
she's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1230
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:32,302
possibly.

1231
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:34,311
should you call?

1232
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:37,195
tell her this is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1233
01:11:37,295 --> 01:11:40,976
megyn? share?
no, she wouldn't do it.

1234
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,954
- what makes you say that?
- because i wouldn't.

1235
01:11:42,954 --> 01:11:47,285
i mean roger plays his women off against
each other, he's always done it, he'll say:

1236
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:49,414
"megyn thinks that lisa
should get your spot", or:

1237
01:11:49,414 --> 01:11:51,719
"megyn suspects
that you're screwing kal."

1238
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:53,518
and then a lawful advice
on how to get back at her,

1239
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,960
as if you brought it up.

1240
01:11:55,022 --> 01:11:56,634
she's renegotiating(renegociação) her deal.

1241
01:11:56,634 --> 01:11:59,989
i could still of roughly
15 million reasons to stay quiet.

1242
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:02,345
we do need some collaboration.

1243
01:12:02,345 --> 01:12:04,623
that would certainly help
with the other networks.

1244
01:12:04,935 --> 01:12:06,835
oh god. what?

1245
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:09,161
what marty?

1246
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:14,241
we've not had a lot of incoming
job interests from them.

1247
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,987
what's not a lot?

1248
01:12:19,365 --> 01:12:21,049
none.

1249
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,298
they're afraid of roger.

1250
01:12:23,661 --> 01:12:25,306
no.

1251
01:12:25,493 --> 01:12:27,570
no woman gets to sue her boss.

1252
01:12:27,673 --> 01:12:31,175
rule #1, corporate america -
you don't sue your boss.

1253
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,333
i jumped off a cliff.

1254
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:41,322
i thought one of them
would stand with me.

1255
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:47,638
- hey, mom.
- hey, we're home.

1256
01:12:48,025 --> 01:12:49,399
hey, honey.

1257
01:12:49,519 --> 01:12:51,358
there's a snack in the kitchen.

1258
01:12:51,358 --> 01:12:53,192
- okay.
- thanks.

1259
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,698
we gonna get him.

1260
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:03,267
megyn doesn't wanna
release a statement.

1261
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:05,688
it could be seen as
influencing the investigation.

1262
01:13:05,688 --> 01:13:08,744
have her say that
to roger's face.

1263
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:12,070
let us know who else
hasn't spoken up for him,

1264
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,187
maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

1265
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:18,725
no, jesus! we need our
anchors. we need her!

1266
01:13:19,401 --> 01:13:20,811
let me talk to her.

1267
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:22,014
yes please.

1268
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:27,121
look, sweetheart, this is
an island of safety and truth.

1269
01:13:27,543 --> 01:13:29,183
i wear pants.

1270
01:13:29,183 --> 01:13:31,580
no one has ever told me
not to wear pants!

1271
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:32,576
i wear pants.

1272
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,517
i'd love to know
where that came from.

1273
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:40,163
we need everyone
on 'team roger', everyone.

1274
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:42,364
- hi.
- good morning.

1275
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,403
come on.

1276
01:13:45,723 --> 01:13:48,589
no one makes me wear shirt skirts.

1277
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,760
he was the first to put a female on
as a host of a prime-time show.

1278
01:13:55,988 --> 01:13:58,067
roger ailes champions women.

1279
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:00,637
no. there is no leg cam.

1280
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,534
could you just hold on for one sec?

1281
01:14:04,754 --> 01:14:06,118
i have to wear pants on.

1282
01:14:06,118 --> 01:14:08,520
not without authorization
from the second floor you don't.

1283
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,268
we never fitted her for pants.

1284
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:12,760
you can print whatever story
you like, but there is no leg cam.

1285
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,656
lily, beth needs me
to talk to megyn.

1286
01:14:15,832 --> 01:14:17,320
i'm gonna do an on-air statement

1287
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,108
where all the fox women come out
one by one behind me for roger.

1288
01:14:20,108 --> 01:14:22,249
that will never happen.

1289
01:14:23,245 --> 01:14:24,639
ains.

1290
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:34,445
you know why roger's got
that door block in his office.

1291
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:38,254
'cause of bangladeshi(bangladesh) from accounting
wandered in one day by mistake.

1292
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:39,724
please.

1293
01:14:39,751 --> 01:14:42,789
it's so girls can come in from
the back elevator and no one sees them.

1294
01:14:43,778 --> 01:14:44,942
really?

1295
01:14:44,989 --> 01:14:48,686
we get talent come in here all the time,
looking to get their faces done.

1296
01:14:48,686 --> 01:14:51,201
"i'm going to see roger,
i gotta look my best."

1297
01:14:51,665 --> 01:14:54,318
one came back up
with her robe off and nose in chin.

1298
01:14:55,985 --> 01:14:57,987
who was that?

1299
01:15:01,307 --> 01:15:03,492
my memory is horrible.

1300
01:15:03,546 --> 01:15:06,036
you should go see jenis in weather.

1301
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:10,251
nobody wants to talk.

1302
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,982
can you blame them?

1303
01:15:12,112 --> 01:15:13,234
no.

1304
01:15:13,374 --> 01:15:15,171
where'd you disappear to?

1305
01:15:16,248 --> 01:15:17,846
i've got names.

1306
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,414
women rumored to have
stories about roger.

1307
01:15:20,414 --> 01:15:22,017
- from who?
- jenis.

1308
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,217
weather jenis?

1309
01:15:23,217 --> 01:15:24,758
everybody confides(confide) at her.

1310
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,587
"nobody from weather
wants your job."

1311
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:27,643
what are gonna do with them?

1312
01:15:27,643 --> 01:15:29,137
tell them this time's different.

1313
01:15:29,137 --> 01:15:29,852
wait...

1314
01:15:29,852 --> 01:15:31,631
no. don't wait.
don't listen to him.

1315
01:15:31,769 --> 01:15:33,749
it's not only your job here.

1316
01:15:33,927 --> 01:15:36,875
i got kids, okay?
lily has a baby now.

1317
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:39,689
julia'll lose her visa
and will have to go back to canada.

1318
01:15:39,855 --> 01:15:43,163
we know that you've been talking
to broadcast networks.

1319
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:46,408
you can get a job anywhere,
but we can't.

1320
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:50,085
and no offense,
but who the hell will you be?

1321
01:15:50,488 --> 01:15:53,753
nobody leaves fox,
megyn. not really.

1322
01:15:53,753 --> 01:15:55,756
it's in your dna now.

1323
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,674
think about what you're
blowing up here.

1324
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:02,208
i say find the truth.

1325
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:12,059
that face tells me nothing.

1326
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:17,552
if they come after you,
it won't be you they come after.

1327
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:29,171
<i>gretchen carlson, your colleague
at fox news, has issued some allegations,</i>

1328
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:32,805
<i>some sexual harassment(assédio) allegations,
over your boss roger ailes.</i>

1329
01:16:32,805 --> 01:16:35,393
<i>what is your position on this?
what did you think when you heard this?</i>

1330
01:16:35,393 --> 01:16:39,935
<i>in this country every famous,
powerful and wealthy person is a target.</i>

1331
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:42,143
<i>you're a target. i'm a target.</i>

1332
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:44,523
<i>anytime somebody could come out</i>

1333
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:48,151
<i>and sue us, attack us,
go to the press or anything like that.</i>

1334
01:16:48,151 --> 01:16:49,936
<i>and that's a deplorable situation.</i>

1335
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:53,741
<i>i've worked for roger ailes for 20 years.
best boss i've ever had.</i>

1336
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,348
i've never been told
what i can't wear.

1337
01:16:57,124 --> 01:17:00,156
i know you didn't ask,
but i think it needs to be said.

1338
01:17:02,364 --> 01:17:04,561
it's a very confusing time right now.

1339
01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:06,144
tonight is manhattanhenge.

1340
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:08,785
sunset will align perfectly
with the city's grid.

1341
01:17:08,785 --> 01:17:12,229
the best viewing streets
are 14th, 34th and 57th.

1342
01:17:12,626 --> 01:17:14,823
good day new york.

1343
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:20,242
a babe with no kiser?
this can't be a fox affiliate.

1344
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:23,670
oh my god. how are you?

1345
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,102
good. how about you?

1346
01:17:25,102 --> 01:17:25,982
good.

1347
01:17:25,982 --> 01:17:27,027
how's your mom?

1348
01:17:27,027 --> 01:17:29,595
she's good. she's training
to be a security guard.

1349
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,264
is that because of the trump(trunfo) stuff?

1350
01:17:31,264 --> 01:17:35,259
no, she just wants a job
where she gets to carry a gun.

1351
01:17:38,778 --> 01:17:42,570
did you come up here
to talk about roger?

1352
01:17:42,984 --> 01:17:45,063
what would make you say that?

1353
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:48,688
i've been in local for two years,
nobody's ever come to see me.

1354
01:17:49,103 --> 01:17:50,629
you miss us?

1355
01:17:51,432 --> 01:17:53,462
the network i worked at for 14 years,

1356
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:57,336
that my dad helped built,
where my brother's a reporter?

1357
01:17:58,342 --> 01:18:00,612
julia, did roger ever...?

1358
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:02,164
no.

1359
01:18:02,913 --> 01:18:05,385
i heard things, but nothing firsthand.

1360
01:18:05,887 --> 01:18:07,414
good.

1361
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:09,749
- i miss you.
- i miss you more.

1362
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:10,883
we should go have a drink.

1363
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:12,348
yes.

1364
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:24,651
roger...

1365
01:18:26,363 --> 01:18:28,085
he has...

1366
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:31,515
detectives on staff, about 14.

1367
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:35,258
they look into enemies, follow them.

1368
01:18:35,258 --> 01:18:38,655
post negative stories online.
it's called the 'black room'.

1369
01:18:38,655 --> 01:18:40,058
i don't want you in danger...

1370
01:18:40,058 --> 01:18:42,433
no. no. i'm not talking about me.

1371
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:46,629
i'm talking about you.

1372
01:18:47,862 --> 01:18:51,325
be careful who you ask questions
about roger ailes.

1373
01:18:56,830 --> 01:19:00,271
my lawyers are negotiating with fox.

1374
01:19:01,878 --> 01:19:04,094
not that bill will pay any of it.

1375
01:19:04,094 --> 01:19:05,316
bill?

1376
01:19:05,316 --> 01:19:07,186
o'reilly.

1377
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:10,167
and jack.

1378
01:19:11,598 --> 01:19:13,242
jesus.

1379
01:19:15,018 --> 01:19:17,035
sorry.

1380
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:20,337
fish rots from the head.

1381
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,087
i'm gonna talk to the outside firm
investigating this.

1382
01:19:28,087 --> 01:19:29,711
paul weiss.

1383
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:32,559
i heard you had some issues over here.

1384
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,269
i did.

1385
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,423
if you have a name to give.

1386
01:19:37,259 --> 01:19:38,689
roger.

1387
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:42,060
i wouldn't ask
if i didn't think it was safe.

1388
01:19:47,437 --> 01:19:48,842
roger.

1389
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:49,771
jack.

1390
01:19:49,771 --> 01:19:51,184
roger.

1391
01:19:51,519 --> 01:19:52,158

1394
01:19:54,263 --> 01:19:55,173
bill.

1395
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:56,843
roger.

1396
01:20:02,687 --> 01:20:04,317
it's kayla, right?

1397
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:06,097
yeah.

1398
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:07,698
hi.

1399
01:20:07,698 --> 01:20:09,897
hi. megyn.

1400
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,557
i know.

1401
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,226
you used to work
with gretchen, right?

1402
01:20:16,683 --> 01:20:18,223
did you learn a lot from her?

1403
01:20:18,223 --> 01:20:19,609
i did. yes.

1404
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:22,732
i have nothing but good things
to say about her.

1405
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:24,268
that's great.

1406
01:20:24,818 --> 01:20:29,901
i always find it so interesting who
history chooses to do something important.

1407
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:33,230
i guess.

1408
01:20:33,923 --> 01:20:36,095
i wanted to ask you...

1409
01:20:39,013 --> 01:20:42,486
i wanted to ask you
if roger is harassing(ivana) you.

1410
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:52,289
how did you know?

1411
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:56,980
we find each other.

1412
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,239
you too?

1413
01:21:01,961 --> 01:21:03,653
long time ago.

1414
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:08,338
wow.

1415
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:18,049
are you okay?

1416
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:29,591
you should report roger.
you'll be protected.

1417
01:21:30,269 --> 01:21:31,776
did you?

1418
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:34,311
i took it to his superior.

1419
01:21:36,649 --> 01:21:39,547
nothing happened.
i had to drop it.

1420
01:21:39,832 --> 01:21:41,502
why?

1421
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:45,463
i wanted to be on television.

1422
01:21:47,223 --> 01:21:49,908
did you think what
your silence would mean

1423
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,124
for us, the rest of us?

1424
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,510
roger is not my fault.

1425
01:21:55,856 --> 01:21:57,646
it would've been nice...

1426
01:21:59,317 --> 01:22:03,429
if somebody told us
that he's after more than legs.

1427
01:22:04,777 --> 01:22:07,111
that's nobody's job
to protect you, kayla.

1428
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:09,945
that's all of our job.

1429
01:22:11,297 --> 01:22:14,836
i don't get you, you're...
you have power.

1430
01:22:15,548 --> 01:22:17,464
why are you still playing
by old rules?

1431
01:22:17,464 --> 01:22:19,466
you're megyn kelly.

1432
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:21,781
look around, snowflake.

1433
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:24,309
how do think i succeeded?

1434
01:22:24,309 --> 01:22:27,590
how do you think a woman gets
a prime time fox show?

1435
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,795
so, you had sex with him?

1436
01:22:32,795 --> 01:22:35,237
jesus fucking christ.

1437
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:53,757
hello.

1438
01:22:54,647 --> 01:22:56,378
hey. it's me.

1439
01:22:56,378 --> 01:22:59,664
oh my god! what the fuck, kayla?

1440
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:01,909
it said bill in my phone.

1441
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:07,586
sorry, i saved my number
under his name in your phone,

1442
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:09,670
as a joke. i forgot.

1443
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:13,001
oh my god. jesus christ.
i had a heart attack.

1444
01:23:14,838 --> 01:23:16,270
where are you?

1445
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,066
i'm on a date.

1446
01:23:21,258 --> 01:23:22,759
okay.

1447
01:23:22,883 --> 01:23:24,469
did you...

1448
01:23:25,676 --> 01:23:29,284
did you give my name
to megyn by any chance?

1449
01:23:30,975 --> 01:23:32,649
i may have...

1450
01:23:33,771 --> 01:23:36,862
worried about you
out loud, once or twice.

1451
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,009
why didn't you just...

1452
01:23:40,243 --> 01:23:41,829
support me?

1453
01:23:42,092 --> 01:23:43,750
i don't even know.

1454
01:23:44,547 --> 01:23:46,727
i couldn't do anything and i...

1455
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,533
i can't fuck up.

1456
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,183
'cause i'm a lesbian at fox news.

1457
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:54,917
so?

1458
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:58,476
who's your date with, kayla?

1459
01:23:59,132 --> 01:24:03,931
i can't just go on a date
with a dude and make it go away.

1460
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:14,367
i think i'm...

1461
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,197
i think i'm gonna call paul weiss.

1462
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:22,771
okay. that's good.
that's really good.

1463
01:24:23,988 --> 01:24:25,626
i'm really glad you're doing that.

1464
01:24:25,754 --> 01:24:28,220
i think that's absolutely
what you should do.

1465
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,884
okay. great.

1466
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,449
i can't call anyone else and i just...

1467
01:24:36,449 --> 01:24:38,373
i need someone right now to...

1468
01:24:38,424 --> 01:24:41,824
tell me that that's what i should do.

1469
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:43,002
oh my god. yes.

1470
01:24:43,002 --> 01:24:46,986
i heard it was like an outside firm,
and they're taking it really seriously.

1471
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:50,137
okay. great. thanks.

1472
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:54,822
kayla.

1473
01:24:56,102 --> 01:24:58,094
what happened?

1474
01:25:00,892 --> 01:25:02,650
i did it.

1475
01:25:06,094 --> 01:25:08,498
i did it. i gave it to him.

1476
01:25:11,924 --> 01:25:13,615
kayla, i...

1477
01:25:15,475 --> 01:25:17,814
i'm so sorry.

1478
01:25:18,954 --> 01:25:21,537
he kept talking, he just
kept talking, kept saying...

1479
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:28,195
"good girl. that's a good girl.
you're a good soldier."

1480
01:25:30,673 --> 01:25:32,639
"earn your place."

1481
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:33,937
fuck.

1482
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,315
he didn't even unbuckle.

1483
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:53,070
i feel so filthy.

1484
01:25:53,254 --> 01:25:57,299
no. kayla. you didn't do
anything wrong.

1485
01:26:00,133 --> 01:26:02,014
i'm sorry.

1486
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:05,947
i better go.

1487
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:11,056
roger can sense vulnerabilities.

1488
01:26:11,197 --> 01:26:14,420
in those days our meetings
were career strategy sessions,

1489
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,135
mixed with good advice,
and comments like.

1490
01:26:18,325 --> 01:26:21,378
the most basic thing is confidence.

1491
01:26:21,772 --> 01:26:23,969
feel at home in your own skin.

1492
01:26:24,144 --> 01:26:26,535
if you're confident, you're sexy.

1493
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:30,893
i'm sure you have some sexy bras.
i'd love to see you in those.

1494
01:26:34,207 --> 01:26:36,295
it was a cat-and-mouse game.

1495
01:26:36,883 --> 01:26:40,644
but he always gave me
good advice and let me deflect.

1496
01:26:41,921 --> 01:26:44,165
tell him to dream on.

1497
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:48,201
the more i let him get away with

1498
01:26:49,858 --> 01:26:52,178
the more he pushed my buttons.

1499
01:26:52,684 --> 01:26:55,691
i don't know if women
can be good interviewers.

1500
01:26:55,691 --> 01:26:59,665
men have that killer instinct,

1501
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:05,246
and we do bad things,
and we do not feel guilty about it.

1502
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:09,322
how can i be sure you have that...

1503
01:27:09,322 --> 01:27:11,553
that kind of drive?

1504
01:27:15,107 --> 01:27:17,241
finally, in january.

1505
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:18,666
this is '06?

1506
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,265
yes.

1507
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:47,410
he grabbed me.

1508
01:27:49,452 --> 01:27:51,554
tried to kiss me.

1509
01:27:59,213 --> 01:28:01,989
i pushed him away twice.

1510
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:10,670
as i was leaving, he asked:
"when is your contract up?"

1511
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:29,321
after the third time i left.

1512
01:28:29,452 --> 01:28:32,240
and he never tried anything again?

1513
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,677
no.

1514
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:37,088
i ignored his calls. stayed in d. c.

1515
01:28:37,864 --> 01:28:40,152
two years later i had a show.

1516
01:28:40,477 --> 01:28:44,042
any long-term consequences?

1517
01:28:47,678 --> 01:28:49,295
yeah...

1518
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:59,387
am i witness "w"?

1519
01:28:59,573 --> 01:29:02,395
yes. why?

1520
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:05,661
it's a 23rd letter in the alphabet.

1521
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:10,170
have 22 other women come forward
since i first spoke to you?

1522
01:29:11,019 --> 01:29:13,177
have they?

1523
01:29:16,436 --> 01:29:18,607
will there be more?

1524
01:29:27,554 --> 01:29:30,469

find every single positive thing
she said about me, and get it out, now!

1539
01:30:14,381 --> 01:30:18,543
roger, i can't discredit
an anchor(âncora) on pay to promote.

1540
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:22,833
then i'll hurl her

1547
01:30:47,406 --> 01:30:48,800
hey, gil.

1548
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,939
hey, greta.

1549
01:30:49,939 --> 01:30:51,619
what's megyn singing?

1550
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:54,023
it's part of a contract negotiation?

1551
01:30:54,195 --> 01:30:57,056
it's not economic, or political.

1552
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:59,162
okay, gil.

1553
01:31:03,236 --> 01:31:06,478
this is scary, it's like the whole world's
on fire and no one can be trusted.

1554
01:31:06,478 --> 01:31:08,378
hey, geraldo, cnn, line six.

1555
01:31:08,378 --> 01:31:09,226
can't talk.

1556
01:31:09,226 --> 01:31:10,787
he is certainly in 'times'.

1557
01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:12,008
why aren't you on the phone?

1558
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,935
to comment on sexual harassment.
we work for bill.

1559

hey, we need you to wear it.

no!

01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:21,758
get it on.

1564
01:31:21,758 --> 01:31:24,290
megyn kelly has no comment.
she's traveling...

1565
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:26,261
to cleveland.

1566
01:31:26,261 --> 01:31:28,636
for the republican(republicano) convention, remember?

1567
01:31:29,225 --> 01:31:30,885
i've known him for 40 years.

1568
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:33,411
and he's about as flirty as
the grizzly, when you rub on it.

1569
01:31:33,411 --> 01:31:34,750
let me tell you something.

1570
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,282
i called these allegations(alegações) sick,
'cause they are sick.

1571
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:39,591
why wasn't i let in on a pact?

1572
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:41,113
what pact?

1573
01:31:41,113 --> 01:31:44,130
breitbart is saying there is a pact
among our top 50 on-air talents.

1574
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:46,039
if roger gets fired, we all walk.

1575
01:31:46,039 --> 01:31:48,291
- great, where do i sign?
- i've never heard of a pact.

1576
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:49,807
me neither.

1577
01:31:51,998 --> 01:31:53,656
roger placed it.

1578
01:31:54,705 --> 01:31:56,994
fake news. come on.

1579
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:59,611
how bad does it look for roger?

1580
01:31:59,901 --> 01:32:01,293
bad.

1581
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:04,252
doesn't feel like i imagined it would.

1582
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:07,884
gretchen, you achieved
something remarkable.

1583
01:32:09,699 --> 01:32:11,376
yes. i did.

1584
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:15,299
mom.

1585
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:18,340
i think it's time we finish this.

1586
01:32:18,495 --> 01:32:20,766
okay. i'll let you know.

1587
01:32:23,873 --> 01:32:25,942
mom, are you done with that?

1588
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:28,670
i'm done.

1589
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:35,269
i made the murdochs 1.5 billion
in profit last year. pure profit.

1590
01:32:35,269 --> 01:32:39,515
fox news is the most successful
cable franchise in history.

1591
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:43,570
gretchen carlson's lawyers.

1592
01:32:44,377 --> 01:32:46,368
she wants to settle.

1593
01:32:46,956 --> 01:32:49,145
it's a lot less appealing
to sue you personally

1594
01:32:49,145 --> 01:32:51,702
without rupert's money behind you.

1595
01:32:55,518 --> 01:32:57,337
hey, ken.

1596
01:32:59,695 --> 01:33:01,429
ken?

1597
01:33:27,016 --> 01:33:29,280
- hey. who's here?
- oh my gosh.

1598
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:31,722
i brought you some small people.

1599
01:33:32,842 --> 01:33:35,599
we practiced(hoodies) that scare for two weeks.

1600
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:37,206
look at you.

1601
01:33:37,365 --> 01:33:38,844
hi.

1602
01:33:38,844 --> 01:33:40,659
look who's here?

1603
01:33:43,572 --> 01:33:45,835
it was so scary.

1604
01:33:45,835 --> 01:33:47,028
thank you.

1605
01:33:47,028 --> 01:33:48,792
how are you, sweetheart?

1606
01:33:48,978 --> 01:33:52,575
i'm either damned for doing it,
or damned for not doing it sooner.

1607
01:33:54,307 --> 01:33:57,267
tell me my big mouth
didn't ruin our life.

1608
01:33:57,416 --> 01:33:59,171
not yet.

1609
01:34:05,183 --> 01:34:08,274
can i speak to roger alone, please?

1610
01:34:16,222 --> 01:34:18,354
are you sure you want beth here?

1611
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:20,093
of course.

1612
01:34:26,485 --> 01:34:29,234
gretchen taped your conversations.

1613
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,155
that's a goddamn lie!

1614
01:34:32,155 --> 01:34:34,300
for over a year.

1615
01:34:38,612 --> 01:34:40,538
but, you don't believe her.

1616
01:34:40,538 --> 01:34:44,083
your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from tapes.

1617
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:46,532
what?

1618
01:34:47,352 --> 01:34:48,750
why didn't they tell us before?

1619
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,737
so you'd issue complete denials.

1620
01:34:53,323 --> 01:34:56,183
so you'd have no credibility.

1621
01:35:01,783 --> 01:35:04,543
apparently, she did her homework.

1622
01:35:21,075 --> 01:35:23,627
<font color="#ffff00"><i>god bless our next
president donald trump.</i></font>

1623
01:35:23,627 --> 01:35:28,409
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and god bless the
united states of america!</i></font>

1624
01:35:31,564 --> 01:35:33,449
mr. giuliani is fired up.

1625
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:37,644
when we come back we'll discuss the speech
with the man who helped drive it.

1626
01:35:39,146 --> 01:35:40,857
don't react, okay?

1627
01:35:41,872 --> 01:35:43,579
roger's out.

1628
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:48,049
is that sourced, gil?

1629
01:35:48,049 --> 01:35:51,263
yeah. the 'new york post'.
they put him on the cover.

1630
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:53,928
rupert's telling him to let go.

1631
01:35:54,694 --> 01:35:56,607
and that's a scoop.

1632
01:35:56,607 --> 01:35:59,136
<i>we gonna win so big.
thank you very much.</i>

1633
01:35:59,486 --> 01:36:02,585
<i>there is some breaking news tonight
in the world of media and politics...</i>

1634
01:36:02,585 --> 01:36:04,389
<i>a blockbuster shake-up at fox news...</i>

1635
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:05,943
<i>a dramatic fall from grace...</i>

1636
01:36:05,943 --> 01:36:08,164
<i>roger ailes is out as top boss.</i>

1637
01:36:08,959 --> 01:36:10,955
they want us to circle the block.

1638
01:36:11,235 --> 01:36:12,832
hold on.

1639
01:36:15,323 --> 01:36:16,778
what's going on?

1640
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,818
i've been shut down.

1641
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:31,574
it's true.

1642
01:36:31,574 --> 01:36:33,696
everything richard said.
it's all true.

1643
01:36:33,696 --> 01:36:35,003
roger lied to me.

1644
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:37,156
why? because i'm a mandra here.

1645
01:36:37,156 --> 01:36:41,079
so, i have concerns my public defense
in roger can be construit as coercive.

1646
01:36:41,224 --> 01:36:43,207
hey. pants.

1647
01:36:43,822 --> 01:36:45,132
fuck off, neil.

1648
01:36:58,557 --> 01:37:00,104
sorry to keep you waiting.

1649
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:01,495
no. no. sit down.

1650
01:37:01,495 --> 01:37:04,002
i appreciate you driving up here, roger.

1651
01:37:04,915 --> 01:37:06,618
susan estrich.

1652
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:11,738
i hate that it's come to this.

1653
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,541
me too.

1654
01:37:25,255 --> 01:37:27,366
we gave these women jobs.

1655
01:37:27,913 --> 01:37:30,365
put them on the air.
made them famous.

1656
01:37:30,957 --> 01:37:36,089
you think for a goddamn second
i did any damage to any of them?

1657
01:37:36,235 --> 01:37:38,496
no, you don't.

1658
01:37:40,357 --> 01:37:42,428
you don't, rupert.

1659
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:47,028
there's now audience
for that side of the story.

1660
01:37:57,148 --> 01:38:01,207
to begin with, half of this you already
owe him from last year's bonus.

1661
01:38:01,207 --> 01:38:02,916
and we're paying it.

1662
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:04,533
and paying off your contract.

1663
01:38:04,533 --> 01:38:05,984
consider yourself lucky.

1664
01:38:05,984 --> 01:38:08,614
it's a contractual(contratual) obligation.

1665
01:38:09,124 --> 01:38:12,852
i created the murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

1666
01:38:13,327 --> 01:38:15,579
a third of your margin.

1667
01:38:15,904 --> 01:38:17,747
there are three of you.

1668
01:38:18,098 --> 01:38:22,498
i guess that means i pay for the food
that one of you puts in your mouth.

1669
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:24,285
what if it's you.

1670
01:38:24,285 --> 01:38:26,279
i'd have fired you for cause...

1671
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:32,633
roger, you've built an amazing business.
no one can take that away from you.

1672
01:38:33,137 --> 01:38:36,527
but, under the circumstances...

1673
01:38:37,185 --> 01:38:39,467
this is a lot of money.

1674
01:38:40,037 --> 01:38:43,279
it won't look good to the people
that don't know your worth.

1675
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:47,122
take it. honor your non-compete.

1676
01:38:54,164 --> 01:38:56,218
i never cared about the money.

1677
01:38:57,128 --> 01:38:58,934
we know, roger.

1678
01:39:05,545 --> 01:39:07,387
okay.

1679
01:39:09,716 --> 01:39:11,170
okay.

1680
01:39:11,364 --> 01:39:13,692
i'd like to go to the newsroom(redação) with you.

1681
01:39:13,842 --> 01:39:17,254
i'd like us to announce
my leaving together.

1682
01:39:22,856 --> 01:39:24,845
no.

1683
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:38,444
the end of the <i>legman</i>.

1684
01:39:40,163 --> 01:39:42,113
i won't miss him.

1685
01:39:42,665 --> 01:39:44,418
boys.

1686
01:39:52,577 --> 01:39:55,126
hope you two know
what you're doing.

1687
01:39:59,124 --> 01:40:02,914
once roger's office is cleared off
handguns, i'll move in.

1688
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:05,434
i'll run the network
till the ship's aride.

1689
01:40:09,126 --> 01:40:10,688
donald.

1690
01:40:11,674 --> 01:40:14,072
how's that speech coming?

1691
01:40:19,878 --> 01:40:23,539
megyn's gotta go! ho ho ho!

1692
01:40:24,497 --> 01:40:26,670
convention's downstairs, folks.

1693
01:40:26,694 --> 01:40:28,257
would you say people are shocked?

1694
01:40:29,054 --> 01:40:31,008
come on. what'd he do to you? megyn?

1695
01:40:31,503 --> 01:40:35,358
<i>of all the ways this could end.
i didn't see this one coming.</i>

1696
01:40:35,924 --> 01:40:39,366
<i>gretchen carlson got the murdochs
to put the right of women above profit,</i>

1697
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:41,042
<i>if only temporarily.</i>

1698
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:45,078
<i>and i found myself
with the job i didn't want.</i>

1699
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,323
<i>i couldn't really leave.</i>

1700
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,293
<i>even when i did.</i>

1701
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,407
you should keep that out.

1702
01:40:59,567 --> 01:41:01,646
people, can i get your attention please?

1703
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:03,578
mr. murdoch is joining us today,

1704
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,247
he has a very important
statement he'd like to say.

1705
01:41:07,527 --> 01:41:10,697
excuse me, everyone.
i won't take long.

1706
01:41:11,272 --> 01:41:14,666
roger ailes is leaving fox.

1707
01:41:15,207 --> 01:41:19,056
i want to start by thanking roger
for his remarkable contribution

1708
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:21,952
to our company, and to our country.

1709
01:41:22,223 --> 01:41:25,328
twenty years ago roger shared...

1710
01:41:25,328 --> 01:41:28,252
<i>here's the thing about
being sexually harassed(assediado) at work.</i>

1711
01:41:29,345 --> 01:41:31,541
<i>it condemns(laude) you to questions.</i>

1712
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:35,475
<i>you keep asking yourself:</i>

1713
01:41:36,097 --> 01:41:39,646
<i>what did i do? what did i say?</i>

1714
01:41:40,124 --> 01:41:42,946
<i>what did i wear? what did i miss?</i>

1715
01:41:44,299 --> 01:41:46,192
<i>am i seen as weak?</i>

1716
01:41:48,518 --> 01:41:50,875
<i>will they say i'm after money?</i>

1717
01:41:52,308 --> 01:41:54,754
<i>will they say i'm after attention?</i>

1718
01:41:56,846 --> 01:41:58,813
<i>will i be left out?</i>

1719
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:04,318
<i>will i be defined(definiram) by this
for the rest of my life?</i>

1720
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,849
i will take over as chairman
and acting ceo

1721
01:42:07,849 --> 01:42:13,015
with the support of our existing
management team under bill shine.

1722
01:42:14,727 --> 01:42:17,734
<i>if i stay do i just
have to put up with it?</i>

1723
01:42:24,921 --> 01:42:27,288
<i>will the next place be different?</i>

1724
01:42:29,446 --> 01:42:32,309
<i>or can i make it different?</i>

1725
01:42:44,815 --> 01:42:45,929
<i>roger always said:</i>

1726
01:42:45,929 --> 01:42:48,770
<i>"everyone on television
only has one real job -</i>

1727
01:42:49,898 --> 01:42:51,643
<i>to be likable."</i>

1728
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,524
<i>well, i don't care if you like me.</i>

1729
01:42:54,848 --> 01:42:57,182
<i>only that you believe me.</i>

1730
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,239
<i>a lot of people, even women,
are skeptical of harassment(assédio) claims,</i>

1731
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,388
<i>until they experience it themselves.</i>

1732
01:43:04,543 --> 01:43:08,650
<i>or know someone who has.
i may be that person for you.</i>

1733
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:10,334
as you could see.

1734
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:12,169
it's 20 million.

1735
01:43:12,169 --> 01:43:13,913
plus the apology.

1736
01:43:14,154 --> 01:43:15,277
correct.

1737
01:43:15,466 --> 01:43:18,104
i can't believe fox agreed
to the apology.

1738
01:43:18,104 --> 01:43:21,286
i mean, it's unheard-of.
i mean, that never happens.

1739
01:43:21,363 --> 01:43:26,410
but you will have to sign that.
it's a strict confidentiality agreement.

1740
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:30,666
many will establish you told the truth, but
no one can ever hear it directly from you.

1741
01:43:30,666 --> 01:43:33,571
you will be muzzled, gretchen.

1742
01:43:42,303 --> 01:43:44,147
maybe.
