2
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,621
i believe in america.

3
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,707
america has made my fortune.

4
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,961
and i raised my daughter
in the american fashion.

5
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:31,841
i gave her freedom, but i taught her
never to dishonor(desonra) her family.

6
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,429
she found a boyfriend, not an italian.

7
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,975
she went to the movies with him.
she stayed out late.

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,727
i didn't protest.

9
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:48,525
two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

10
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,195
they made her drink whiskey

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,658
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

12
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,870
she resisted, she kept her honor.

13
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,208
so they beat her like an animal.

14
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:12,006
when i went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,553
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

16
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,225
she couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

17
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,730
but i wept. why did i weep?

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,735
she was the light of my life.

19
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
beautiful girl.

20
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,079
now she will never be beautiful again.

21
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,792
(coughs)

22
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,962
sorry.

23
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,933
i went to the police,
like a good american.

24
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,728
these two boys were brought to trial.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,565
the judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

26
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,775
but suspended the sentence.

27
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:18,948
suspended the sentence!
they went free that very day!

28
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,537
i stood in the courtroom like a fool.

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,124
those two bastards, they smiled at me.

30
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:34,964
then i said to my wife, " for justice,
we must go to don corleone. "

31
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,807
vito: why did you go to the police?
why didn't you come to me first?

32
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:50,980
what do you want of me? tell me
anything, but do what i beg you to do.

33
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,774
what is that?

34
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,703
(whispering) i want them dead.

35
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,133
that i cannot do.

36
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,971
i'll give you anything you ask.

37
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:30,853
i've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

38
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:37,068
i can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

39
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,990
even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

40
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:47,078
but let's be frank here.
you never wanted my friendship.

41
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,915
and you were afraid to be in my debt.

42
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,418
bonasera: i didn't want to
get into trouble.

43
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,212
i understand.

44
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,550
you found paradise in america.

45
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:07,515
you made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

46
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,351
you didn't need a friend like me.

47
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,523
but now you come to me and say,

48
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,067
" don corleone, give me justice. "

49
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,780
but you don't ask with respect.

50
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,577
you don't offer friendship. you don't
even think to call me godfather.

51
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:36,210
you come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

52
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,838
bonasera: i ask you for justice.

53
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,924
that is notjustice.
your daughter is alive.

54
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,429
let them suffer , then, as she suffers.

55
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,808
how much shall i pay you?

56
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,410
bonasera, bonasera.

57
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,623
what have i ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

58
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,251
if you'd come in friendship,

59
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,798
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

60
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:28,096
and if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

61
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,810
and then they would fear you.

62
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,482
be my friend?

63
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,987
godfather?

64
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
good.

65
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:57,834
some day, and that day may never
come, i'll ask a service of you.

66
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,337
but until that day

67
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,427
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

68
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,929
<i> -gràzie, godfather.
-prego.</i>

69
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,472
(people chattering(tagarelice) outsi de)

70
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,689
give this to clemenza.

71
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,486
i want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

72
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,699
we're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker(agente funerário) says.

73
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,202
(band playing
traditional italian music)

74
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,835

75
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,478
-where's michael?
-don't worry, he'll be here.

76
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,690
we're not taking the picture
without michael.

77
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,734
(speaking italian)

78
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,407
-what's the matter?
-it's michael.

79
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,775
(all cheering)

80
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,750
vito: don barzini.

82
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,478
hey, paulie! let me have some wine.

83

84
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,986
-you look terrific on the floor.
-are you a dance judge or something?

85
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,821
(speaking italian)

86
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,823
take a walk and do your job.

87
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,330
(music stops)

88
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,167
sandra, watch the kids.
don't let them run wild.

89
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,670
you watch yourself, all right?

90
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,965
(band playing mazurka)

91
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:13,112
20 , 30 grand. in small bills, cash.

92
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,449
in that little silk purse.

93

<i>if this were somebody else's wedding...
sfortunato!</i>

96
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,500
pauli e: stupid jerk!

97
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,553
what's the matter?

98
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,401
-have to go back to work.
-tom.

99
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,739
no sicilian(siciliano) can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

100
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:07,583
don corleone,  honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

101
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,675
get out of here!
it's a private party. go on!

102
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,679
what is it? it's my sister's wedding.

103
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,021
sonny: goddamn fbi
don't respect nothing!

come here, come here, come here!

105
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:54,213
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the american war effort,

106
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,383
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

107
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,219
nazorine, what can i do for you?

108
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,221

00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:43,429
-who should i give this job to?
-not to our paisan.

117
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:48,642

tom : he's not on the list,
but luca brasi wants to see you.

121
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,724
is this necessary?

122
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:33,479
he didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

123
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:40,236
don corleone,  honored and

127
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,415

00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,922
-he's a very scary guy.
-what's his name?

130
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,718
his name is luca brasi.

134
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,941
my brother tom hagen,
miss kay adams.

135
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,028
your father's been asking for you.

-very nice to meet you.
-nice to meet you.

137
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,369
why does your brother
have a different name?

138
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:34,373
my brother sonny found tom hagen
in the street.

139
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,294
he had no home,
so my father took him in.

140

he's been with us ever since.

141

he's a good lawyer.

142
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,639
not a sicilian. i think
he's going to be consigliere.

143
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,642
-what's that?
-that's a,

144
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,479
like a counselor , an advisor.
very important for the family.

145
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,649

158
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,961
no!

159
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,718
<i>(speaking italian)</i>

160
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,930
<i>(singing
che la luna)</i>

161
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,952
<i>(singing

162
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,778
(all singing)

163
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,160
senator cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

164
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,289
also some of the judges.
they've all sent gifts.

165
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,457
(toasting in italian)

166
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,459
(women scream ing)

167
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,710
what is that outside?

168
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:20,349
johnny! johnny!

169
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,060
i love you!

170
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,898
(scream ing continues)

171
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,824
he came all the way from california.
i told you he'd come!

172
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,410
-he's probably in trouble again.
-he's a good godson.

173
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,707
johnny, johnny! sing a song!

174
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,334
(all cheering)

175
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,184
you never said
you knew johnny fontane!

176
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,313
-sure. you want to meet him?
-great! sure.

177
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,234
-my father helped him with his career.
-he did?

178
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,402
how?

179
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,904
<i>(johnny singing
i have but one heart)</i>

180
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,782
-let's listen to this song.
-michael...

181
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,576
(women scream ing)

182
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,276
please, michael. tell me.

183
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,826
when johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

184
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,829
with a big bandleader.

185
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:10,125
and as his career got better and better ,
he wanted to get out of it.

186
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,879
johnny is my father's godson.

187
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,299
my father went to see this bandleader.

188
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,303
he offered him $ 10 ,000
to let johnny go,

189
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,139
but the bandleader said no.

190
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:29,603
so the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with luca brasi.

191
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,607
within an hour ,

192
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,154
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1 ,000.

193
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,160
-how did he do that?
-made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

194
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:51,708
-what was that?
-luca brasi held a gun to his head,

195
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:57,005
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

196
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,679
that's a true story.

197
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,890
<i>(singing in italian)</i>

198
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,818
that's my family, kay. it's not me.

199
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,362
(all applauding)

200
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,040
mama corleone: beautiful!

201
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,546
(indistinct chattering)

202
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,408
i'll take care of it.

203
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,368
tom...

204
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,205
i want you to find santino.
tell him to come to the office.

205
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,299
how are you, fredo?

206
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,968
my brother fredo, this is kay adams.

207
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,430
-hi.
-how are you doing?

208
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,895
-this is my brother mike.
-are you having a good time?

209
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,272
yeah. this is your friend?

210
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:42,277
johnny: i don't know what to do.
my voice is weak. it's weak.

211
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:50,494
anyway, if i had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

212
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,916
but this...man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

213
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,294
-what's his name?
-woltz.

214
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,507
he won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

215
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,012
tom : sonny?

216
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,807
sonny?

217
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,475
(both moaning)

218
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,145
(knock on door)

219
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,481
tom : sonny?

220
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,110
-sonny, are you in there?
-what?

221
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,028
the old man wants you.

222
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,989
one minute.

223
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,326
(both moaning)

224
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,374
(singing in italian)

225
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:47,467
johnny: a month ago he bought the
movie rights to this book, a best -seller.

226
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,138
the main character
is a guy just like me.

227
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,890
i wouldn't even have to act.

228
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,686
godfather , i don't know what to do.

229
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,316
you can act like a man!
what's the matter with you?

230
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,072
is this how you turned out? a hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

231
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:13,201
(m i m icking(erva) johnny) "what can i do?
what can i do?" what is that nonsense?

232
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,036
ridiculous.

233
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,836
-you spend time with your family?
-sure i do.

234
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,546
good.

235
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,342
because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

236
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,393
you look terrible. i want you to eat.

237
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:43,815
rest, and in a month this hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

238
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,027
it's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

239
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,238
going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

240
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:58,079
just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

241
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,376
-i want you to leave it all to me.
-all right.

242
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,722
(band playing)

243
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,657
-what time does my daughter leave?
-soon, after they cut the cake.

244
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,369
do we give your son -in -law
something important?

245
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:42,791
never. give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

246
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,669
-what else?
-virgil sollozzo called.

247
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:50,215
-we'll have to see him next week.
-when you come back from california.

248
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,719
-when am i going to california?
-tonight.

249
00:25:54,844 --> 00:26:00,141
i want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for johnny.

250
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,647
if there's nothing else, i'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

251
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,735
carlo, we're going to take the picture.

252
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,572
m ichael: wait a minute.

253
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,991
kay: no, michael. not me.

254
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,331
okay, that's it. just like that. hold it!

255
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,587
(band playing waltz)

256
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,598
(bell ringing)

257
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,769
(all chattering)

258
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,151
man: you need
a little more heat on that arc.

259
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,611
start talking.

260
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,115
i was sent by a friend
of johnny fontane.

261
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,952
this friend would give
his friendship to mr. woltz,

262
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,913
if mr. woltz would grant us a favor.

263
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,461
give johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

264
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,131
(chuckles)

265
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:44,222
and what favor would your friend
grant mr. woltz?

266
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,809
he could make your future union
problems disappear.

267
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,980
and one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

268
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,401
are you trying to muscle me?
listen, you son -of-a -bitch!

269
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,070
let me lay it on the line.

270
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,114
johnny fontane
will never get that movie!

271
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,785
no matter how many dago guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

272
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,664
- german -irish.
-listen here, my kraut -mick friend.

273
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:14,169
- going to make trouble for you!
- a lawyer. i haven't threatened...

274
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,630
i know new york's big lawyers.
who are you?

275
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:21,259
i have a special practice.
i handle one client.

276
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,344
i'll wait for your call.

277
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,016
by the way,
i admire your pictures very much.

278
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,355
check him out.

279
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,380
-it's really beautiful.
-look at this.

280
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:04,010
-it used to decorate a king's palace.
-very nice.

281
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,471
woltz: why didn't you say
you work for corleone?

282
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,767
i thought you were some cheap hustler
johnny was running in.

283
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,187
-i only use his name when necessary.
-woltz: how's your drink?

284
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,816
-fine.
-now i'll show you something beautiful.

285
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,443
you do appreciate beauty, don't you?

286
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,491
there you are. $600 ,000 on four hoofs.

287
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,537
i bet russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

288
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,121
khartoum.

289
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,082
khartoum.

290
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,963
not going to race him, though.
going to put him out to stud.

291
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,091
thanks, tony.

292
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,845
let's get something to eat.

293
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,306
tom : corleone is johnny's godfather.

294
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:54,853
to the italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

295
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,815
i respect it.
tell him to ask me anything else.

296
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,276
this favor i can't give him.

297
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,654
he never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

298
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:10,910
you don't understand.
johnny fontane(fontano) never gets that movie.

299
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,664
that part is perfect for him.
it'll make him a big star.

300
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,877
going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

301
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:25,592
johnny fontane(fontano) ruined one of woltz
international's most valuable protégés.

302
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:31,014
we trained her for five years.
singing, acting, dancing lessons.

303
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,768
i spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her , to make her a big star.

304
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,646
let me be even more frank.

305
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,693
to show you that  not a hard -hearted
man. that it's not all dollars and cents.

306
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,447
she was beautiful.
she was young and innocent!

307
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,911
she's the greatest piece of ass i've had
and i've had them all over the world.

308
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:59,167
then johnny fontane(fontano) comes along with
his olive(oliva) oil voice and guinea(guiné) charm.

309
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,919
and she runs off.

310
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,382
she threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

311
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:11,638
and a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

312
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,057
you get the hell out of here!

313
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,519
if that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him  no bandleader.

314
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,774
yeah, i heard that story.

315
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,695
thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

316
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,615
maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

317
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,285
mr. corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

318
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,750
(woltz scream ing)

319
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,885
(scream ing continues)

320
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,860
-you're not too tired, are you, tom?
-no, i slept on the plane.

321
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,030
i have the sollozzo notes here.

322
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,364
now...

323
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,953
sollozzo is known as the turk.

324
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,997
he's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

325
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,502
<i>but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.</i>

326
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,838
<i>his business is narcotics.</i>

327
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,300
<i>he has fields in turkey,
where they grow poppy.</i>

328
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,221
<i>in sicily(sicília) he has plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

329
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,849
<i>he needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.</i>

330
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,812
<i>he'll give a piece of the action.
i don't know how much.</i>

331
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:11,150
<i>the tattaglia family is behind him here.
they have to be in it for something.</i>

332
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:17,031
-what about his prison record?
-one term in italy, one here.

333
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,867
he's known as a top narcotics(narcóticos) man.

334
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:24,622
-santino, what do you think?
-a lot of money in that white powder.

335
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,334
tom?

336
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:32,588
<i>tom: yes. there's more money
in narcotics(narcóticos) than anything else.</i>

337
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:37,426
<i>if we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.</i>

338
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,973
with that money they can buy
more police and political power.

339
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,142
then they come after us.

340
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:50,773
now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great¤, but narcotics(narcóticos) is the future.

341
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,945
if we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

342
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,578
so? what's your answer
going to be, pop?

343
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,084
don corleone.

344
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,464
i need a man who has powerful friends.

345
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,301
i need a million dollars in cash.

346
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:24,223
i need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels(níquel) and dimes.

347
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,729
-what is the interest for my family?
-30%.

348
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,774
in the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

349
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,818
and then it would go up.

350
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,448
and what is the interest
for the tattaglia family?

351
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,285
my compliments.

352
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,417
i'll take care of them, out of my share.

353
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,755
so i receive 30% for finance,

354
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,217
political influence and legal protection?

355
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,968
that's right.

356
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:06,224
why do you come to me?
why do i deserve this generosity?

357
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:11,604
if you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

358
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,856
te salud, don corleone.

359
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:29,580
i said that i would see you, because
i heard you were a serious man,

360
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,916
to be treated with respect.

361
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,924
but, i must say no to you.

362
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,928
and i'll give you my reason.

363
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,806
it's true,
i have a lot of friends in politics.

364
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,520
they wouldn't be friendly long if i was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

365
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:58,234
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

366
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:03,281
it doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

367
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:08,619
but your business is...a little dangerous.

368
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:13,165
if you're worried about security,
the tattaglias will guarantee it.

369
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,752
-the tattaglias would guarantee our...
-wait a minute.

370
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,848
i have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and i spoil them.

371
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,143
they talk when they should listen.
but anyway...

372
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:37,648
signor sollozzo, my no is final. i wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

373
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,193
i know you'll do well, and good luck.

374
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:46,115
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. thank you.

375
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,679
santino.

376
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,598
come here.

377
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,810
what's the matter with you?

378
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:19,565
your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

379
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,736
never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

380
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,322
go on.

381
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,120
tom, what's this nonsense?

382
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,582
it's from johnny.
he's starring in that new film.

383
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,504
-take it away.
-take it over there.

384
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,340
and

385
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,510
tell luca brasi to come in.

386
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,144
a little worried
about this sollozzo fellow.

387
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,189
find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

388
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,819
go to the tattaglias.

389
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:09,198
make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

390
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,952
and find out what you can.

391
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,722
i got something for your mother
and for sonny

392
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:38,477
and a tie for freddy,
and tom hagen got the reynolds pen.

393
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,814
-what do you want for christmas?
-just you.

394
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,319
<i>(have yourself a merry little
christmas playing on radio)</i>

395
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,681
vito: andiamo, fredo.

396
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,185
-tell paulie to get the car.
-okay, pop.

397
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:23,189
i'll have to get it myself.
paulie called in sick this morning.

398
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,235
paulie's a good kid.
i don't mind getting the car.

399
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,824
<i>buon natale, caro. gràzie.</i>

400
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,746
-luca!  bruno tattaglia.
-i know.

401
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,666
(both speaking italian)

402
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,674
you know who i am?

403
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,092
(in italian) i know you.

404
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,972
(in italian) you have been talking
to the tattaglia family...right?

405
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,977
i think you and i can do business.

406
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,481
i need someone strong like you.

407
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,943
i heard you are not happy...

408
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,654
...with the corleone family.

409
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,156
want to join me?

410
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,285
what's in it for me?

411
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,832
$50 ,000 to start with.

412
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,085
not bad!

413
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,380
agreed?

414
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,691
(speaking italian)

415
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,447
(grunting)

416
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,704
(choking)

417
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,541
(gasping)

418
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,526
tom! tom hagen. merry christmas.

419
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:19,573
-glad to see you. i want to talk to you.
-i haven't got time.

420
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,701
make time, consigliere. get in the car.

421
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:29,083
what are you worried about? if i wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

422
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,584
get in.

423
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,307

428
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,533
would you like me better
if i were a nun? like in the story.

429
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,704
no.

430
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:35,125

no, i wouldn't like you better
if you were ingrid bergman.

433
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,468
what's the matter?

434
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,612
they don't say if he's dead or alive.

435
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,371
(horn blaring)

436

464
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,496
<i>listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.</i>

465
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,209
<i>what's done is done. don't lose that
famous temper of yours, sonny.</i>

466
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,961
i'll wait.

467
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,629
<i>(hangs up)</i>

468
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,185
sollozzo: your boss is dead.

469
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:47,609
i know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

470
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,572
i want you to help the corleones
and me.

471
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:01,039
we got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

472
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,750
drink it.

473
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,925
it's up to you to make peace
between me and sonny.

474
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,932
sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

475
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,186
and you knew
it was the right thing to do.

476
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:29,401
-sonny will come after you.
-that will be his first reaction, sure.

477
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:37,409
so you have to talk sense into him.
the tattaglia family is behind me.

478
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:42,581
the other new york families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

479
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:47,836
let's face it, with all due respect,
the don  - rest in peace  - was slipping.

480
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,842
ten years ago,
could i have gotten to him?

481
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:01,683
well, now he's dead, tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

482
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:09,357
you've got to talk to sonny, to the
caporegimes, tessio, fat clemenza.

483
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,406
it's good business, tom.

484
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:22,621
i'll try. but even sonny won't be able
to call off luca brasi.

485
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,459
yeah, well...

486
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,671
let me worry about luca.

487
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,304
you just talk to sonny.

488
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,598
and the other two kids.

489
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,062
-i'll do my best.
-good.

490
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,858
now you can go.

491
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:03,370
i don't like violence, tom.
a businessman.

492
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,914
blood is a big expense.

493
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,020
he's still alive.

494
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,066
they hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

495
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,863
that's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

496
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:27,454
your mother is at the hospital with
your father. looks like he'll pull through.

497
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:35,921
it's a lot of bad blood. sollozzo, philip
tattaglia, bruno tattaglia, ramon...

498
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,130
m ichael: you gonna kill all those guys?

499
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,424
stay out of it.

500
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,968
tom : if you get rid of sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

501
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:46,306
what about luca?
sollozzo thinks he can control him.

502
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:50,185
if luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

503
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,897
-has anyone been in touch with luca?
-we've been trying all night.

504
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,232
hey, do me a favor...

505
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,984
tom : luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

506
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:05,283
well, tom, you're consigliere.
what do we do if the old man dies?

507
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:12,666
if we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

508
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:18,421
the other new york families might
support sollozzo to avoid a long war.

509
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:23,009
this is almost 1 946.
nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

510
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,761
if your father dies

511
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,974
you make the deal.

512
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:33,895
-easy to say. he's not your father.
- as much a son as you or mike.

513
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,400
(knock on door)

514
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,026
what is it?

515
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:46,825
-paulie, i told you to stay put.
-the guy at the gates has a package.

516
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,994
tessio, go see what it is.

517
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,582
-shall i stay?
-sonny: yeah. are you all right?

518
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,461
- fine.
-there's food. are you hungry?

519
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:02,090
-no.
-a drink? brandy will sweat it out.

520
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,801
-go ahead.
-that might be a good idea.

521
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:12,642
take care of that son -of-a -bitch.
paulie sold out the old man.

522
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,271
-make that the first thing on your list.
-understood.

523
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:20,692
mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to luca's apartment.

524
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,487
maybe we shouldn't get mike
mixed up in this too directly.

525
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,744
hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

526
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,538
try luca again.

527
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,258
-what's this?
-tessio: a sicilian(siciliano) message.

528
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,178
it means luca brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

529
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,687
(chi ldren yelling)

530
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,985
- going.
-when will you be home?

531
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,737
probably late.

532
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,951
-don't forget the cannoli!
-yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:18,708
rocco, sit on the other side.
you block the rear -view mirror.

534
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:23,671
sonny's running wild. he wants
to go to mattresses(colchões) already.

535
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:29,636
we have to find a spot on the
west side. try 309 west 43rd street.

536
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,264
-know a good spot on the west side?
-i'll think about it.

537
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:37,102
think while you're driving.
i want to hit new york this month.

538
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,895
watch the kids.

539
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,533
rocco: paulie, go down 39th street,

540
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:55,620
pick up 1 8 mattresses
and bring me the bill.

541
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,122
pauli e: yeah, all right.

542
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,665
rocco: make sure they're clean,

543
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,626
because the guys
will be there a long time.

544
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,920
pauli e: they're clean
and exterminated.

545
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,964
rocco: (chuckling)
that's a bad word to use.

546
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,968
exterminate! watch out,
so we don't exterminate(exterminar) you!

547
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,595
(rocco chattering(tagarelice) in italian)

548
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,180
(both laughing)

549
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,185
rocco: pull over.
i've got to take a leak.

550
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,733
(shi p horn blowing)

551
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,698

552
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,796
(gunshots)

553
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,516
(car door opening)

554
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,272
leave the gun. take the cannoli.

555
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,335
clemenza: hey, mike! hey, mikey!

556
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,422
-yeah.
-phone call!

557
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,597
-who is it?
-some girl.

558
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,312
<i>-hello. kay?
-kay: how's your father?</i>

559
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,439
he's going to make it.

560
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,691
<i>i love you.</i>

561
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,068
huh?

562
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,778
<i>i love you!</i>

563
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,240
<i> -michael?
-yeah, i know.</i>

564
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:58,243
<i> -tell me you love me.
-i can't talk.</i>

<i>can't you say it?</i>

566
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,289
i'll see you tonight.

567
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,168
why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

568
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:11,756
i love you with all my heart. if i don't
see you again soon,  going to die!

569
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,132
(clemenza chuckling)

570
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:18,012
come and learn something. you might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

571
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,766
you start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

572
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:27,480
throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

573
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:31,651
you get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

574
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,655
add a little bit of wine.

575
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:43,329
and a little bit of sugar. that's my trick.

576
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,667
cut the crap. i have more important
things for you. how's paulie?

577
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,003
you won't see him no more.

578
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,965
-where are you going?
-to the city.

579
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,510
-send bodyguards(guarda-costas) with him.
- going to the hospital...

580
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,972
clemenza: he'll be all right.
sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

581
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,016
-be careful.
-yes, sir.

582
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,021
send somebody with him anyway.

583
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,367
<i>(all of my life
playing on radio)</i>

584

-i have to go.
-can i go with you?

585
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:45,725
no, kay. there will be detectives there,
people from the press.

586
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,894
i'll wait in the cab.

587
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,149
i don't want you to get involved.

588
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,112
when will i see you again?

589
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:08,581
go back to new hampshire,
and i'll call you at your parents' house.

590
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:15,088
-when will i see you again, michael?
-i don't know.

592
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:31,182
what are you doing here?
you're not supposed to be here.

593

michael corleone. this is my father.

594
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,188
what happened to the guards?

595
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:42,652
your father had too many visitors.
they interfered with hospital service.

596
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:46,072
the police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

597

get me long beach 45620 , please.

sonny,  at the hospital.
i got here late, there's nobody here.

600
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:12,682

we're going to move him
to another room.

604
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,281
can you disconnect the tubes?

605
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,868
-that's out of the question!
-do you know my father?

606
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:36,289
men are coming here to kill him.
do you understand?

607
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,124
help me, please.

you'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

612

to help you. for your father.

613
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:16,180
listen. wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

614
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,307
i'll be out in a minute.

615
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,825
just lie here, pop.
i'll take care of you now.

616
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,829
with you now.

617
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,999
with you.

618
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,619
get rid of these. come here.

619
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:26,000
put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. you'll be all right.

620
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:29,920
(m ichael sighs)

621
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,299
(whispering)

622
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,978
(car approaching)

623
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,011
you did good.

624
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,403
(si rens wai ling)

625
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,547
(thunder rumbling)

626
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,771
i thought all you guinea(guiné) hoods
were locked up!

627
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:15,526
-why isn't anyone guarding my father?
-you little punk!

628
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:19,572
don't you tell me my business!
i pulled them off.

629
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:25,578
-stay away from this hospital!
-not until my father's room is guarded.

630
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,707
-phil, take him in!
-the kid's clean, captain.

631
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:33,586
-he's a war hero. he's never been...
-i said take him in!

632
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:42,011
-what's the turk(turco) paying you?
-take a hold of him. stand him up.

633
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:43,971
stand him up straight.

634
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:11,790
the corleones' attorney. these men
are hired to protect vito corleone.

635
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,293
they're licensed to carry firearms.

636
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:18,797
if you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

637
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,841
let him go.

638
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:57,169
-what's with all the new faces?
-we'll need them now.

639
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:00,172
after the hospital thing, sonny got mad.

640
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:03,342
we hit bruno tattaglia this morning.

641
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,512
jesus christ.

642
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,688
looks like a fortress around here.

643
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:23,195
tamaduch! hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

644
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,865
that turk(turco) shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

645
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,995
mike, let me look at you.

646
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,085
you're beautiful, beautiful.
you're gorgeous.

647
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:43,799
the turk(turco) wants to talk!
imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.

648
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,635
-he wants a meeting today.
-what did he say?

649
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,557
what did he say... he wants us to send
michael to hear the proposition.

650
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:55,060
he promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

651
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:58,230
-and bruno tattaglia?
-that's part of the deal.

652
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:02,609
-he cancels(cancela) out what they did to father.
-we should listen to them.

653
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,863
no more! not this time, consigliere.

654
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:09,450
no more meetings, discussions,
or sollozzo tricks.

655
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,578
i want sollozzo, or we go to war...

656
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,622
-the other families...
-they hand me sollozzo!

657
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:22,546
-they shot my father...
-even that was business, not personal.

658
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:27,217
then business will have to suffer.
do me a favor.

659
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:31,263
no more advice on how
to patch things up. just help me win.

660
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:41,523
i found out about captain mccluskey,
who broke mike's jaw.

661
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:45,903
he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

662
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:49,990
mccluskey has agreed
to be the turk's bodyguard.

663
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,827
so when sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

664
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:57,539
nobody has ever gunned down
a new york police captain.

665
01:12:57,664 --> 01:13:03,587
all the families would come after you.
the corleone family would be outcasts!

666
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:07,466
even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

667
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,638
do me a favor.
take this into consideration.

668
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,477
all right, we'll wait.

669
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,693
we can't wait. we can't wait.

670
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:32,157
no matter what sollozzo says,
he's going to kill pop.

671
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:35,953
that's the key for him.
we've got to get sollozzo.

672
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:40,332
-mike is right.
-sonny: let me ask you something.

673
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:45,003
what about this mccluskey?
what do we do with this cop?

674
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:53,011
they want to have a meeting
with me, right?

675
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:58,350
it will be me, mccluskey and sollozzo.

676
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,354
let's set the meeting.

677
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:08,193
get our informers(informantes) to find out
where it's going to be held.

678
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:13,866
we insist it's a public place.
a bar , a restaurant.

679
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,703
some place where there are people,
so i feel safe.

680
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:23,459
they'll search me
when i meet them, right?

681
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,878
so i can't have a weapon on me.

682
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:34,219
but if clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

683
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,393
then i'll kill them both.

684
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,355
(clemenza chuckling)

685
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:58,160
nice college boy. didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

686
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:01,955
now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped(bateu) you?

687
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:08,545
this isn't like the army! you have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

688
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,715
you're taking this very personal.

689
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,177
tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

690
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,805
-where does it say you can't kill a cop?
-mikey...

691
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:25,020
talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

692
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:30,359
a cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

693
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:34,988
that's a terrific story. we have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

694
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:40,285
-they might like a story like that.
-they might.

695
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:47,584
it's not personal, sonny.
it's strictly business.

696
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,172
clemenza: it's as cold as they come.

697
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:55,801
impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

698
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:59,972
i put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. try it.

699
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,361
is the trigger too tight?

700
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,907
my ears!

701
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:23,662
i left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.

702
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,708
you've shot them both.
now what do you do?

703
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,797
-sit down, finish my dinner.
-don't fool around.

704
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,384
let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

705
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:41,888
everybody will still think you've got it.
they'll stare at your face,

706
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,850
so walk out fast, but don't run.

707
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:48,353
don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

708
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:51,982
they'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

709
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:58,280
you'll be all right. you'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

710
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,407
and we'll catch the hell.

711
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,870
-how bad do you think it will be?
-pretty goddamn bad.

712
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,040
all the other families will probably
line up against us.

713
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:13,712
these things have to happen every five,
10 years. gets rid of the bad blood.

714
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:18,258
been 10 years since the last one.
you have to stop them at the beginning.

715
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:24,056
like they should have stopped hitler in
munich, not letting him get away with it.

716
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:30,020
you know, mike, we were all proud
of you. being a hero and all.

717
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,772
your father too.

718
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:41,865
(clicks)

719
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:13,271
nothing. not a hint. absolutely nothing.

720
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:18,485
even sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

721
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,946
how much time do we have?

722
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:26,618
they're going to pick you up outside
jack dempsey's in an hour and a half.

723
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,455
clemenza: we could
put a tail on them.

724
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,457
sollozzo would lose our ass.

725
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:38,463
-what about the negotiator?
-he's playing pinochle with my men.

726
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:43,635
-he's happy. they're letting him win.
-too risky. maybe we should call it off.

727
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,097
the negotiator(negociador) plays cards
until mike is back safe.

728
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,184
-he could blast whoever is in the car.
-clemenza: they'll expect that.

729
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,520
sollozzo might not even be
in the car , sonny!

730
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:54,646
(telephone ringing)

731
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:56,189
i'll get it.

732
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,675
louis' restaurant in the bronx.

733
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,095
-is it reliable?
-my man in mccluskey's precinct.

734
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:32,893
a police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. he'll be there between 8 and 10.

735
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:37,856
-anybody know this joint?
-sure, i do. it's perfect for us.

736
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:42,903
a small family place, good food.
everyone minds his business. perfect.

737
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:48,867
they've got an old -fashioned toilet.
you know, the box and the chain thing.

738
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,955
we might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

739
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:58,168
all right. mike, you go to the restaurant,

740
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:02,130
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
make them relax.

741
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:07,552
then you go to take a leak. no,
better still, you ask permission to go.

742
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:12,057
then you come back blasting.
two shots in the head apiece.

743
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,353
i want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

744
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:19,898
i don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

745
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:25,570
-the gun will be there.
-you drive him and pick him up.

746
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,280
let's move.

747
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,956
did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

748
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,916
yeah, a million times.

749
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:46,925
don't forget. two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

750
01:20:53,473 --> 01:20:57,102
how long do you think it will be
before i can come back?

751
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:00,021
at least a year.

752
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:04,943
i'll square it with mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

753
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:10,282
i'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

754
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,622
take care.

755
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,168
take care, mike.

756
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,830
glad you came. i hope
we can straighten everything out.

757
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:05,170
it's not the way i wanted things to go.
it should never have happened.

758
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:09,507
i want to straighten everything out.
i don't want my father bothered again.

759
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,844
i swear on my children
that he won't be, mike.

760
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:17,182
but you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

761
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:21,686
i hope you're not a hothead like sonny.
you can't talk business with him.

762
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,480
(speaking italian)

763
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:25,190
mccluskey: he's a good kid.

764
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,697
sorry about the other night, mike.

765
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:36,868
i've got to frisk you, so turn around.
on your knees, facing me.

766
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:46,670
i guess  getting too old for my job.
too grouchy.

767
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:51,883
can't stand the aggravation.
you know how it is.

768
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,595
he's clean.

769
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,457

770
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,586

771
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,438
(horns blaring)

772
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,613

774
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,033
mccluskey: i'll have it.

775
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,827
(speaking italian)

776
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:18,863
- going to speak italian to mikey.
-go ahead.

777
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:27,038
(both speaking italian)

778
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,111
what i want...

779
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,281
what's most important to me

780
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:50,205
is that i have a guarantee.
no more attempts on my father's life.

781
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:55,043
what guarantees can i give you?
the hunted one!

782
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,713
i missed my chance.
you think too much of me, kid.

783
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,632
not that clever.

784
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:04,385
all i want is a truce.

785
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:14,729
i have to go to the bathroom.
is it all right?

786
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,650
when you got to go, you got to go.

787
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:26,074
he's clean.

788
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:28,243
don't take too long.

789
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,122
i've frisked(frisado) a thousand punks.

790
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:11,119
(toi let flushing)

01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:51,367
(sollozzo speaking italian)

792
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,611
(choking)

793
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:24,312
(chattering)

794
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,311
(si ren wai ling)

795
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:25,790
okay, you take over.

796
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,586
(all chattering)

797
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,934
i love you, grandpa.

798
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,519
(baby crying)

799
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:50,565
connie:  sorry, pa.
he doesn't know you yet.

800
01:32:55,111 --> 01:33:01,367
" i hope you get well, grandpa, and wish
i see you soon. your grandson frank. "

801
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:06,664
go with your mother.

802
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,874
take them downstairs.

803
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,008
go on, carlo, you too.

804
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:20,469
go on.

805
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,641
(all chattering)

806
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:45,036
-what's the matter with you, carlo?
-shut up and set the table.

807
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:06,682
since mccluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

808
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:13,314
and also the other families.
there's been a lot of bad blood.

809
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:16,859
they hit us, so we hit them back.

810
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:22,281
through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

811
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:26,661
about mccluskey's link with sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

812
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:28,871
so things are loosening(afrouxamento) up.

813
01:34:30,122 --> 01:34:34,877
and  sending fredo to las vegas,

814
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,505
under the protection
of don francesco of l.a.

815
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:42,134
-i want him to rest.
- going to learn the casino business.

816
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:52,228
(softly) where's michael?

817
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,702
it was michael who killed sollozzo.

818
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:13,332
but he's safe. we're starting to work
to bring him back.

819
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:37,106
i want you to find out
where that old pimp tattaglia is hiding.

820
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:39,150
i want him now.

821
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:42,778
sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

822
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:47,575
if you go after tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. pop can negotiate.

823
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:53,664
-he must get better first. i'll decide...
-war is costly. we can't do business.

824
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:57,585
-neither can they. don't worry about it!
-we can't afford a stalemate.

825
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:02,673
-no more stalemate. i'll kill the bastard!
-you're getting a great reputation!

826
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:08,804
do as i say! if i had a sicilian(siciliano) wartime
consigliere. i wouldn't be in this shape!

827
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:11,140
pop had genco. look what i got.

828
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,062
sorry. i didn't mean that.

829
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,150
ma made a little dinner. it's sunday.

830
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:26,489
niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in harlem.

831
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:30,743
driving new cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

832
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:34,163
that's because
they've started making big money.

833
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:37,541
papa never talked business
at the table.

834
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,504
-carlo: shut up, connie...
-don't you ever tell her to shut up.

835
01:36:42,254 --> 01:36:43,297
don't interfere.

836
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:49,553
i'd like to talk to you after dinner.
i could do more for the family...

837
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,431
we don't discuss business at the table.

838
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:32,638
(horn honks)

839
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:42,231
(in italian)
i kiss your hand, don tommasino.

840
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,822
why are you so far
from the house?

841
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,158
you know  responsible to your
father for your life.

842
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,535
the bodyguards(guarda-costas) are here.

843
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,745
it's still dangerous...

844
01:37:57,913 --> 01:37:59,665
we've heard from santino
in new york...

845
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:03,294
your enemies know you're here.

846
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:07,089
did santino say when
i can go back?

847
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,552
it's out of the question.

848
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:16,432
where are you going now?

849
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:19,143
to corleone.

850
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:21,020

851
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:25,399
i want to walk.

852
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,153
be careful.

853
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:45,377
(bell tolling)

854
01:38:49,465 --> 01:38:51,133
michael. corleone.

855
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,105
(in italian)
where have all the men gone?

856
01:39:06,148 --> 01:39:08,359
they're all dead from vendettas.

857
01:39:09,985 --> 01:39:12,363
there are the names of the dead.

858
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:32,925
hey, hey, take me to the america, g. i. !

859
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:37,304
hey, hey, take me to the america, g. i. !

861
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,812

01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,898
(women singing)

863
01:40:00,577 --> 01:40:02,663
(in italian) mamma mia what a beauty.

864
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:04,415
(speaking italian)

865
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,882
i think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

866
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:24,101
(in italian) in sicily(sicília) women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

867
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:37,698
(speaking italian)

868
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,917
did you have a good hunt?

869
01:40:49,918 --> 01:40:52,254
you know all the girls
around here?

870
01:40:52,796 --> 01:40:54,298
we saw some real beauties.

871
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:58,594
one of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

872
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:04,600
she would tempt the devil himself.

873
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:07,686
(repeating in italian)

874
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:14,401
really put together.

875
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,527
right, calo?

876
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:16,695
(repeating in italian)

877
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:21,283
such hair , such mouth!

878
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:26,830
the girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

879
01:41:27,372 --> 01:41:29,750
this one had a purple dress...

880
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:32,252
and a purple ribbon in her hair.

881
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:36,298
a type more greek than italian.

882
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:38,300
(repeating)

883
01:41:38,717 --> 01:41:40,552
do you know her?

884
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:47,768
there's no girl like that
in this town.

885
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:51,688
my god, i understand!

886
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:53,941
(owner shouting in italian)

887
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:56,819
what's wrong?

888
01:41:58,987 --> 01:42:00,405
let's go.

889
01:42:02,324 --> 01:42:03,617
it's his daughter.

890
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:05,577
tell him to come here.

891
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,290
call him.

892
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,220
(men chattering(tagarelice) in italian)

893
01:42:30,352 --> 01:42:32,688
fabrizio, you translate.

894
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,569
i apologize if i offended you.

895

a stranger in this country.

897
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,326
i meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

898
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:54,668
an american, hiding in sicily.

899
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:58,380
my name is michael corleone.

900
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:04,553
there are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

901
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:09,766
but then your daughter
would lose a father

902
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,770
instead of gaining a husband.

903
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:24,114
i want to meet your daughter.

904
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:29,369
with your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

905
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:31,705

02:08:16,438 --> 02:08:20,609
he had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1076
02:08:20,734 --> 02:08:23,612
he refused to share them.

1077
02:08:23,696 --> 02:08:27,449
when did i ever refuse
an accommodation?

1078
02:08:27,574 --> 02:08:29,910
all of you know me.

1079
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:36,041
when did i ever refuse,
except one time? and why?

1080
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:43,549
because i believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1081
02:08:43,632 --> 02:08:47,886
it's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1082
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:53,934
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the church.

1083
02:08:54,059 --> 02:08:58,731
even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1084
02:08:58,814 --> 02:09:03,068
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1085
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:08,240
i believed that then
and i believe that now.

1086
02:09:08,323 --> 02:09:10,534
times have changed.

1087
02:09:10,659 --> 02:09:15,414
it's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1088
02:09:15,497 --> 02:09:18,333
a refusal is not the act of a friend.

1089
02:09:18,459 --> 02:09:23,839
if don corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1090
02:09:23,964 --> 02:09:28,510
or let others use them. he must let us
draw the water from the well.

1091
02:09:29,595 --> 02:09:33,182
certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1092
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:35,851
after all, we're not communists.

1093
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:42,065
i also don't believe in drugs.

1094
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:47,029
for years i paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1095
02:09:47,154 --> 02:09:50,282
somebody says to them
" i have powders. "

1096
02:09:50,365 --> 02:09:53,869
" if you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

1097
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:56,455
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

1098
02:09:57,873 --> 02:10:03,879
they can't resist. i want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1099
02:10:03,962 --> 02:10:08,717
i don't want it near schools,
i don't want it sold to children.

1100
02:10:08,842 --> 02:10:10,636
<i>that's an infàmia.</i>

1101
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:15,891
in my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1102
02:10:15,974 --> 02:10:19,144
they're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1103
02:10:25,734 --> 02:10:29,363
i hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1104
02:10:30,739 --> 02:10:37,412
and  willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1105
02:10:37,996 --> 02:10:42,501
we are agreed. the traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1106
02:10:42,584 --> 02:10:46,922
don corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1107
02:10:47,047 --> 02:10:50,759
i must have strict assurance
from corleone.

1108
02:10:50,884 --> 02:10:54,179
as time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

1109
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:56,849
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1110
02:10:56,932 --> 02:11:02,104
barzini : we are all reasonable men.
we don't have to give assurances.

1111
02:11:02,229 --> 02:11:05,107
you talk about vengeance.

1112
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:08,443
will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1113
02:11:08,527 --> 02:11:11,029
or my boy to me?

1114
02:11:11,113 --> 02:11:13,907
i forgo the vengeance of my son.

1115
02:11:16,702 --> 02:11:19,037
but i have selfish reasons.

1116
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:24,877
my youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1117
02:11:26,753 --> 02:11:29,298
because of this sollozzo business.

1118
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:34,720
and i have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1119
02:11:34,803 --> 02:11:37,472
cleared of all these false charges.

1120
02:11:38,932 --> 02:11:42,102
but  a superstitious man.

1121
02:11:42,227 --> 02:11:47,482
if an unlucky(azarado) accident should befall(acontecer) him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¤,

1122
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:52,487
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1123
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:55,407
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1124
02:11:56,658 --> 02:12:00,287
then  going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1125
02:12:01,955 --> 02:12:04,291
and that i do not forgive.

1126
02:12:06,752 --> 02:12:09,129
but, that aside

1127
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,593
let me say that i swear

1128
02:12:16,178 --> 02:12:19,306
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1129
02:12:19,431 --> 02:12:23,769
that i will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1130
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:54,758
should i insist that all of tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1131
02:12:54,841 --> 02:12:56,927
mention it. don't insist.

1132
02:12:58,929 --> 02:13:03,850
-barzini will know without being told.
-you mean tattaglia.

1133
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:07,437
tattaglia's a pimp.

1134
02:13:08,522 --> 02:13:11,650
he could never have outfought(estufa) santino.

1135
02:13:14,027 --> 02:13:19,616
but i didn't know until this day
that it was barzini all along.

1136
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:37,175
come on, nancy.

1137
02:13:38,385 --> 02:13:40,971
keep together , everyone. brian.

1138
02:13:42,305 --> 02:13:43,974
okay, all right.

1139
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,239
how long have you been back?

1140
02:14:00,032 --> 02:14:01,867
i've been back a year.

1141
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:05,412
longer than that, i think.

1142
02:14:08,248 --> 02:14:10,417
it's good to see you, kay.

1143
02:14:21,428 --> 02:14:23,972
working for my father now, kay.

1144
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:29,478
he's been sick. very sick.

1145
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:32,981
but you're not like him.

1146
02:14:33,065 --> 02:14:36,860
you told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1147
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:43,116
my father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1148
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,703
any man who's responsible
for other people.

1149
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:50,332
like a senator or president.

1150
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:52,876
-how naive you sound.
-why?

1151
02:14:52,959 --> 02:14:55,754
they don't have men killed.

1152
02:14:58,965 --> 02:15:00,967
who's being naive, kay?

1153
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:06,515
my father's way of doing things is over.
even he knows that.

1154
02:15:08,058 --> 02:15:12,437
in five years the corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1155
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:18,235
trust me. that's all i can tell you
about my business. kay...

1156
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:22,781
michael, why did you come here? why?

1157
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:28,954
what do you want with me after all
this time? i've been calling and writing.

1158
02:15:29,037 --> 02:15:32,541
i came because i need you.
i care for you.

1159
02:15:32,624 --> 02:15:36,461
-please stop it, michael.
-because... i want you to marry me.

1160
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:40,757
-it's too late.
-please, kay...

1161
02:15:42,467 --> 02:15:46,388
i'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1162
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:52,477
because that's important, kay.
because what's important is that

1163
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:57,274
we have each other.
that we have a life together.

1164
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:01,570
that we have children. our children.

1165
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:05,240
kay, i need you.

1166
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,785
and i love you.

1167
02:16:30,891 --> 02:16:34,686
tessio: barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1168
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:38,440
-soon i'll have no place to hang my hat!
-m ichael: be patient.

1169
02:16:38,523 --> 02:16:41,651
tessio:  not asking for help.
just take off the handcuffs.

1170
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,863
m ichael: be patient.
carlo: we must protect ourselves.

1171
02:16:44,946 --> 02:16:48,408
-let me recruit some new men.
-m ichael: no.

1172
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:52,370
-barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-tessio: mike, you're wrong.

1173
02:16:53,872 --> 02:16:56,082
clemenza: don corleone...

1174
02:16:56,166 --> 02:17:00,253
you once said that one day tessio
and me could form our own family.

1175
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:04,382
till today i would never think of it.
i must ask your permission.

1176
02:17:05,383 --> 02:17:08,094
michael is now head of the family.

1177
02:17:08,178 --> 02:17:12,432
if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1178
02:17:12,515 --> 02:17:14,935
after we make the move to nevada

1179
02:17:15,018 --> 02:17:19,397
you can leave the corleone family
and go on your own.

1180
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:23,818
-tessio: how long will that be?
-six months.

1181
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:27,155
forgive me, but with you gone,

1182
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:30,075
me and pete
will come under barzini's thumb.

1183
02:17:30,158 --> 02:17:35,830
i hate that barzini. in six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1184
02:17:35,914 --> 02:17:38,833
-do you have faith in my judgment?
-yes.

1185
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:41,836
-do i have your loyalty?
-always, godfather.

1186
02:17:41,962 --> 02:17:45,215
then be a friend to michael.
do as he says.

1187
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:55,475
things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1188
02:17:55,558 --> 02:17:57,852
that's all i can tell you now.

1189
02:17:58,687 --> 02:18:01,314
carlo, you grew up in nevada.

1190
02:18:01,398 --> 02:18:04,734
when we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1191
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:09,614
tom hagen is no longer consigliere.
he'll be our lawyer in vegas.

1192
02:18:09,698 --> 02:18:12,242
that's no reflection on tom,
just how i want it.

1193
02:18:12,325 --> 02:18:17,038
if i ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? that's it.

1194
02:18:37,058 --> 02:18:40,895
-thank you, papa.
- happy for you, carlo.

1195
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:43,857
mike... why am i out?

1196
02:18:45,358 --> 02:18:48,111
you're not a wartime(tempo de guerra) consigliere. tom.

1197
02:18:49,404 --> 02:18:52,657
things may get rough with the move.

1198
02:18:52,741 --> 02:18:54,034
tom.

1199
02:18:59,205 --> 02:19:04,377
i advised michael. i never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1200
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:08,590
i thought santino was a bad don,
rest in peace.

1201
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:13,261
michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1202
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:19,225
but there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1203
02:19:20,268 --> 02:19:23,313
-maybe i could help.
-you're out, tom.

1204
02:19:33,490 --> 02:19:34,991
(door closing)

1205
02:20:12,570 --> 02:20:16,866
i can't get over the way your face looks.
so good!

1206
02:20:16,991 --> 02:20:21,538
this doctor did some job.
did kay talk you into it? hey, hey, hey!

1207
02:20:21,621 --> 02:20:25,750
leave them out here.
he's tired and wants to clean up.

1208
02:20:25,834 --> 02:20:28,169
let me open the door , all right?

1209
02:20:29,587 --> 02:20:32,173
<i>(playing
for he's a jolly good fellow)</i>

1210
02:20:34,342 --> 02:20:39,806
-hello, mike! welcome to las vegas!
-all for you, kid! it's all his idea.

1211
02:20:39,889 --> 02:20:42,475
johnny: your brother freddy.
fredo: girls?

1212
02:20:50,733 --> 02:20:54,237
-anything you want, kid, anything.
-who are the girls?

1213
02:20:55,655 --> 02:20:59,033
-that's for you to find out.
-get rid of them, fredo.

1214
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:05,248
-hey, mike...
- here on business. get rid of them.

1215
02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:08,001
tired. get rid of the band too.

1216
02:21:13,882 --> 02:21:17,177
hey, take off. take off. let's go.

1217
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,345
hey, that's it. hey, angelo.

1218
02:21:21,097 --> 02:21:23,183
hey, come on! scram!

1219
02:21:24,893 --> 02:21:28,438
come on, honey. i don't know
what's the matter with him, johnny.

1220
02:21:28,521 --> 02:21:29,814
sorry.

1221
02:21:31,774 --> 02:21:34,319
i don't know. he's tired.

1222
02:21:39,908 --> 02:21:41,242
(door closing)

1223
02:21:41,326 --> 02:21:44,412
what happened to moe greene?

1224
02:21:44,496 --> 02:21:48,875
he had some business. he said to
give him a call when the party started.

1225
02:21:48,958 --> 02:21:50,877
well, give him a call.

1226
02:21:52,212 --> 02:21:55,381
-johnny, how are you?
-nice to see you, mike.

1227
02:21:55,465 --> 02:21:57,675
m ichael: we're proud of you.
johnny: thanks.

1228
02:21:57,759 --> 02:22:01,387
sit down, i want to talk to you.
the don is proud too.

1229
02:22:01,471 --> 02:22:03,681
well, i owe it all to him.

1230
02:22:04,891 --> 02:22:06,476
he knows how grateful you are.

1231
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:09,812
that's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1232
02:22:09,896 --> 02:22:11,814
mike, what can i do?

1233
02:22:12,982 --> 02:22:15,443
we're thinking of giving up our interests

1234
02:22:15,527 --> 02:22:18,404
in the olive(oliva) oil business
and settling here.

1235
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:24,619
moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1236
02:22:24,702 --> 02:22:27,455
-tom!
-are you sure?

1237
02:22:27,539 --> 02:22:30,542
moe loves the business.
he never said nothing about selling.

1238
02:22:30,625 --> 02:22:33,336
i'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1239
02:22:34,587 --> 02:22:37,048
see, johnny...

1240
02:22:37,131 --> 02:22:41,344
we figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers(jogadores) to the casino.

1241
02:22:41,427 --> 02:22:45,181
we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1242
02:22:48,101 --> 02:22:52,730
perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1243
02:22:53,982 --> 02:22:56,109
we're counting on you.

1244
02:22:58,111 --> 02:23:01,781
sure, mike.
i'll do anything for my godfather.

1245
02:23:01,864 --> 02:23:03,157
good.

1246
02:23:04,784 --> 02:23:09,414
hey, mike! hello, fellows.
everybody's here. freddy, tom.

1247
02:23:09,497 --> 02:23:12,041
-good to see you.
-how are you, moe?

1248
02:23:12,166 --> 02:23:17,255
have everything? specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1249
02:23:17,338 --> 02:23:20,925
draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1250
02:23:23,595 --> 02:23:26,306
is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1251
02:23:28,099 --> 02:23:29,934
buy me out?

1252
02:23:30,018 --> 02:23:32,604
the casino, the hotel.

1253
02:23:32,687 --> 02:23:35,607
the corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1254
02:23:35,690 --> 02:23:41,112
the corleone family wants
to buy me out? no, i buy you out.

1255
02:23:41,195 --> 02:23:44,616
your casino loses money.
we can do better.

1256
02:23:44,699 --> 02:23:48,578
-you think  skimming off the top?
-you're unlucky.

1257
02:23:53,333 --> 02:23:55,793
you guineas(guinéus) make me laugh.

1258
02:23:55,918 --> 02:24:00,506
i took freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1259
02:24:01,841 --> 02:24:05,345
you did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1260
02:24:10,767 --> 02:24:13,519
yes. first of all, you're all done.

1261
02:24:13,603 --> 02:24:16,022
you don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1262
02:24:16,147 --> 02:24:20,526
the godfather(padrinho) is sick. you're getting
chased out of new york by the others.

1263
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:24,530
do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1264
02:24:24,614 --> 02:24:29,661
i talked to barzini. i can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1265
02:24:29,744 --> 02:24:33,247
is that why you slapped(bateu) my brother
around in public?

1266
02:24:33,331 --> 02:24:38,169
that was nothing, mike.
moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1267
02:24:38,252 --> 02:24:42,465
he flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1268
02:24:42,548 --> 02:24:47,303
i have a business to run.
i've got to kick asses sometimes.

1269
02:24:47,387 --> 02:24:51,265
we had an argument,
so i had to straighten him out.

1270
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:54,185
you straightened my brother out?

1271
02:24:54,268 --> 02:24:58,731
he was banging cocktail waitresses!
players couldn't get a drink.

1272
02:24:58,815 --> 02:25:00,733
what's wrong with you?

1273
02:25:05,655 --> 02:25:08,616
i leave for new york tomorrow.
think about a price.

1274
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:09,784
(drink spi lling)

1275
02:25:09,867 --> 02:25:11,327
son -of-a -bitch!

1276
02:25:11,411 --> 02:25:16,582
moe greene! i made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1277
02:25:16,666 --> 02:25:19,168
wait a minute, moe. i have an idea.

1278
02:25:20,253 --> 02:25:23,840
<i>tom, you're the consigliere.
talk to the don...</i>

1279
02:25:23,965 --> 02:25:29,345
just a minute. don is semi -retired and
mike is in charge of the family business.

1280
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:32,765
if you have anything to say,
say it to michael.

1281
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:36,853
(door slamm ing)

1282
02:25:37,687 --> 02:25:42,483
mike, you don't come to las vegas and
talk to a man like moe greene like that!

1283
02:25:43,234 --> 02:25:44,444
fredo...

1284
02:25:45,653 --> 02:25:48,406
you're my older brother , and i love you.

1285
02:25:49,866 --> 02:25:53,870
but don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1286
02:25:55,371 --> 02:25:56,581
ever.

1287
02:26:04,547 --> 02:26:08,676
i have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1288
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:15,308
this weekend we'll go out. we'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1289
02:26:22,732 --> 02:26:25,777
your sister wants to ask you something.

1290
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:27,987
-let her ask.
-she's afraid to.

1291
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:31,032
they want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1292
02:26:31,115 --> 02:26:32,950
-we'll see.
-will you?

1293
02:26:33,034 --> 02:26:35,328
let me think about it. come on.

1294
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:47,089
barzini will move against you first.

1295
02:26:47,173 --> 02:26:51,594
he'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1296
02:26:51,677 --> 02:26:53,721
guaranteeing your safety.

1297
02:26:54,972 --> 02:26:58,017
and at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1298
02:27:02,814 --> 02:27:05,817
i like to drink wine more than i used to.

1299
02:27:07,193 --> 02:27:10,738
-anyway,  drinking more.
-it's good for you, pop.

1300
02:27:15,785 --> 02:27:17,286
i don't know.

1301
02:27:19,330 --> 02:27:22,250
are you happy with your wife
and children?

1302
02:27:23,251 --> 02:27:26,087
-very happy.
-that's good.

1303
02:27:27,922 --> 02:27:32,802
i hope you don't mind the way i keep
going over this barzini business.

1304
02:27:32,927 --> 02:27:35,847
-no, not at all.
-it's an old habit.

1305
02:27:37,306 --> 02:27:40,268
i spend my life trying not to be careless.

1306
02:27:41,853 --> 02:27:45,314
women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1307
02:27:48,609 --> 02:27:50,987
-how's your boy?
-he's good.

1308
02:27:51,112 --> 02:27:53,781
he looks more like you every day.

1309
02:27:56,534 --> 02:28:00,955
he's smarter than i am. he's three
and can read the funny papers.

1310
02:28:03,124 --> 02:28:05,126
read the funny papers.

1311
02:28:12,383 --> 02:28:18,014
i want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in - and out -going calls.

1312
02:28:18,139 --> 02:28:23,477
-i did it already. i took care of that, pop.
-that's right. i forgot.

1313
02:28:27,481 --> 02:28:29,191
what's the matter?

1314
02:28:29,984 --> 02:28:32,069
what's bothering you?

1315
02:28:35,656 --> 02:28:40,328
i'll handle it. i told you i can handle it,
so i'll handle it.

1316
02:28:53,549 --> 02:28:58,054
i knew that santino
would have to go through all this.

1317
02:28:58,179 --> 02:28:59,764
and fredo...

1318
02:29:02,516 --> 02:29:04,518
fredo was, well...

1319
02:29:06,395 --> 02:29:09,231
but i never wanted this for you.

1320
02:29:11,525 --> 02:29:16,614
i worked my whole life. i don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1321
02:29:16,697 --> 02:29:20,618
and i refused to be a fool,

1322
02:29:20,701 --> 02:29:24,872
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1323
02:29:26,791 --> 02:29:30,211
i don't apologize. that's my life,
but i thought that,

1324
02:29:31,879 --> 02:29:37,093
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1325
02:29:38,886 --> 02:29:44,558
senator corleone. governor corleone.
something.

1326
02:29:44,642 --> 02:29:47,645
<i>another pezzonovante.</i>

1327
02:29:47,728 --> 02:29:49,397
well...

1328
02:29:52,566 --> 02:29:56,529
just wasn't enough time, michael.
wasn't enough time.

1329
02:29:56,612 --> 02:30:00,116
we'll get there, pop. we'll get there.

1330
02:30:04,954 --> 02:30:09,417
now listen, whoever comes to you
with this barzini meeting,

1331
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:12,420
he's the traitor. don't forget that.

1332
02:30:29,437 --> 02:30:31,522
can i hold it, please?

1333
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:50,541
-can i water these?
-yes, go ahead.

1334
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:53,377
over here, over here.

1335
02:30:55,296 --> 02:30:57,798
be careful. you're spilling it.

1336
02:31:01,635 --> 02:31:03,304
(anthony laughing)

1337
02:31:04,138 --> 02:31:05,890
anthony!

1338
02:31:05,973 --> 02:31:07,683
come here, come here.

1339
02:31:12,813 --> 02:31:15,483
that's it. we'll put it right there.

1340
02:31:17,026 --> 02:31:18,319
(sighing)

1341
02:31:20,738 --> 02:31:23,324
i'll show you something. come here.

1342
02:31:25,367 --> 02:31:27,244
stand there.

1343
02:31:30,998 --> 02:31:32,750
give me an orange!

1344
02:31:36,003 --> 02:31:37,338
(growling)

1345
02:31:39,381 --> 02:31:41,008
(anthony crying)

1346
02:31:41,092 --> 02:31:42,676
(vito laughing)

1347
02:31:51,102 --> 02:31:52,853
that's a new trick.

1348
02:31:53,896 --> 02:31:56,232
you run in there. run in there.

1349
02:32:08,619 --> 02:32:09,703
(vito laughing)

1350
02:32:09,787 --> 02:32:11,705
anthony: where are you?

1351
02:32:17,086 --> 02:32:18,420
(coughing)

1352
02:32:19,588 --> 02:32:21,257
(anthony laughing)

1353
02:32:26,262 --> 02:32:28,055
(coughing continues)

1354
02:32:32,726 --> 02:32:34,395
(anthony laughing)

1355
02:32:41,610 --> 02:32:42,945
(anthony exclai(exclui) m ing)

1356
02:32:48,993 --> 02:32:50,744
(anthony chattering)

1357
02:33:04,842 --> 02:33:06,343
(bell tolling)

1358
02:35:09,383 --> 02:35:11,760
mike, can i have a minute?

1359
02:35:21,895 --> 02:35:24,315
barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1360
02:35:24,398 --> 02:35:27,735
he says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1361
02:35:28,402 --> 02:35:30,571
-you talked to him?
-yeah.

1362
02:35:31,905 --> 02:35:35,743
i can arrange security. on my territory.

1363
02:35:38,787 --> 02:35:41,290
-all right?
-all right.

1364
02:35:58,807 --> 02:36:01,810
do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1365
02:36:04,313 --> 02:36:07,983
they're arranging a meeting
in brooklyn. tessio's ground.

1366
02:36:10,152 --> 02:36:11,945
where i'll be safe.

1367
02:36:24,166 --> 02:36:27,753
i always thought it would be clemenza,
not tessio.

1368
02:36:27,836 --> 02:36:31,673
it's the smart move.
tessio was always smarter.

1369
02:36:33,884 --> 02:36:35,177
but  going to wait.

1370
02:36:35,844 --> 02:36:36,887
after the baptism.

1371
02:36:40,724 --> 02:36:44,353
i've decided to be godfather
to connie's baby.

1372
02:36:44,478 --> 02:36:48,565
and then i'll meet
