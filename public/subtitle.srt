That's not possible.

No, sir.

Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.

or saluting(saudando) the flag and doing my duty.

Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.

00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,838
He does not practice violence.

559
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,152
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

560
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,792
You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious(consciencioso) objector.

561
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,797
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

562
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,314
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

563
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,791
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

564
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,516
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

565
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,831
It is what we men fight for.

To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

568
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,475
So I will expect everyone in this company

569
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,839
to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

Well, I'm trying to understand, all right?

623
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,160
Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?

624
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,358
God says not to kill.

625
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,233
That's one of His
most important Commandments.

626
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,870
Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."

627
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,317
War is a completely different
set of circumstances.

628
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,872
Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,

629
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,953
that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."

630
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,197
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

631
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,557
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.

632
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,031
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.

But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,994
His religious views are certainly unique,

635
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,596
but they do not constitute(constituir) grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.

conscientious objector,

in all other areas of his training.
