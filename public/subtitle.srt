40
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,175
we did a segment

49
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,525

she's not a feminist.

158

is watch fox.

166

168
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,670

00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:25,886
take your(seu) vacation.
i'll handle this.

309
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,020
- oh, my god.
- do you hear the phones?

310
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,079
doug.

311
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:28,980
i have(ter) to call(chamar) you back.

312
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,224
<i>would you like(como) to
correct yourself</i>

313
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,518
<i>on that(este) other(de outros) talking(conversando) point
about men being dominant?</i>

314
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,920
<i>we don't have(ter) any time.
i wish we did.</i>

315
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,130
<i>we're running over,
we're running over.</i>

316
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,691
<i>yeah, well, hr is on the phone
'cause you called(chamado) me a skirt.</i>

317
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,102
<i>i gotta(preciso) read
that manual again.</i>

318
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,595
<i>i'll bring it to your(seu) office
right after(depois de) the show.</i>

319
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:44,596
<i>some guy came(veio) up
to me and said,</i>

320
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,740
<i>"i saw you on</i> fox & friends
this morning.

321
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,500
<i>"is gretchen as cute in person
as she is on tv?"</i>

322
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,110
<i>- oh, come(venha) on.
- and what(o que) did you answer him?</i>

323
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:51,168
<i>beautiful dress.</i>

324
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:52,736
<i>you look(olhar) wonderful.
great color.</i>

325
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,105
<i>in summary,
gretchen's beautiful.</i>

326
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,540
<i>beautiful. you look(olhar) beautiful.</i>

327
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,509
<i>well, you look(olhar) fabulous, too.</i>

328
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,644
<i>'cause you gotta(preciso) wax?
does the waxing hurt?</i>

329
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,513
<i>uh, he looks at me for that!</i>

330
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,056
<i>we'll try that.
women are everywhere.</i>

331
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,791
<i>we're letting 'em play golf
and tennis now.</i>

332
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:05,926
<i>- it's outta control.
- you know(conhecer) what?</i>

333
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,060
<i>you know...
she's out.</i>

334
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:10,889
<i>you read the headlines,
since men are so great.</i>

335
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:11,940
<i>she needed a shower.</i>

336
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,692
the attitude off-camera
was even(até) worse.

337
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,629
steve simply started
ignoring me.

338
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:20,164
what did mr. ailes say
when you complained?

339
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,767
he said, "you act
like it only(só) rains on women.

340
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,838
"stop getting goddamn(maldito) offended
by everything.

341
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:28,106
"you're a man-hater."

342
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,243
and, um, "learn to get along
with the boys."

343
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,611
then he took me off the show.

344
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:34,979
but gave(deu) you your(seu) own.

345
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:37,181
well, in the afternoon
dead zone.

346
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,050
i mean, it was a demotion
and we both knew it.

347
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:43,121
even though i did increase
the ratings by 15%.

348
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,524
he moved me
to second(segundo) base.

349
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,692
<i>back in minnesota,</i>

350
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,562
<i>before i graduated
summa cum laude from(a partir de) stanford,</i>

351
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,697
<i>before i was crowned
miss america,</i>

352
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,098
<i>i played second(segundo) base</i>

353
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,167
<i>in the sixth-grade
softball league.</i>

354
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,338
i hate second(segundo) base.

355
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,307
did he ever(sempre) offer
to reverse that(este) decision

356
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,577
if you made(fez) yourself
sexually available?

357
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,178
not directly.

358
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:10,048
with roger,
it's always(sempre) about(cerca de) loyalty.

359
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,584
he says(diz) he can fix things
if you're loyal.

360
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:14,986
and you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

361
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,122
we don't guess.

362
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,058
oral sex.

363
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,492
roger likes to joke,

364
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,095
"to get ahead,
you gotta(preciso) give(dar) a little head."

365
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,130
really.

366
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:27,198
but mr. ailes

367
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:30,201
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex?

368
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:33,104
i mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

369
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:35,273
like, "you're sexy
but you're too much work."

370
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,608
you're... i mean...

371
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:39,811
i have(ter) a whole list in here

372
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:42,080
because that's just
how roger is.

373
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:43,390
what do you want
out of a lawsuit?

374
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:47,352
what do i want?
i want(querer) this(isto) behavior to stop.

375
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:50,154
someone has to speak up.
someone has to get mad.

376
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:52,255
well, that(este) may not be you.

377
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,192
your contract will(vai) have(ter) a clause

378
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,628
requiring secret,
mandatory arbitration.

379
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,105
you familiar
with rudi bakhtiar's case?

380
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,969
<i>- yes.
- well, you're supposed to be.</i>

381
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,268
my first(primeiro) act as
dc bureau chief...

382
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,104
i want(querer) you down(baixa) here(aqui) full-time.

383
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,640
oh, my god.

384
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,207
that's amazing. yes.

385
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:11,843
you do know
what this(isto) means for you?

386
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,078
<i>shit.
he doesn't think(pensar) i'm ready.</i>

387
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:16,380
brian, i will(vai) not let you down.

388
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,949
i'm gonna(vai) bust my ass for you.

389
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:20,084
well, rudi, come(venha) on,
that's a given.

390
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,886
<i>so, what's the problem?</i>

391
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,122
but, um...

392
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:28,259
look, you do get
how i feel(sentir) about(cerca de) you, right?

393
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:31,196
<i>oh, fuck.
fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

394
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,799
well, i'm glad
you said(disse) that, brian,

395
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,333
because i really(verdade) respect
you, too.

396
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,637
no. no. i mean...

397
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,240
how i really(verdade) feel.

398
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,875
<i>just look(olhar) confused.</i>

399
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,812
all i want(querer) from(a partir de) you, rudi,

400
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,248
is to see the inside
of your(seu) hotel room.

401
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,817
<i>god damn it.</i>

402
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,284
that's all it's gonna(vai) take.

403
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,288
<i>don't react.
make it your(seu) fault.</i>

404
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,058
brian, if i've done anything

405
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,959
to make(fazer) you think
i feel(sentir) that(este) way about(cerca de) you,

406
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,828
i apologize.

407
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:04,895
<i>friends.</i>

408
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,164
we're friends.

409
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,432
<i>professionals.</i>

410
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,034
we have
a great(excelente) professional vibe.

411
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,335
<i>now sell it.</i>

412
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:12,202
i just(somente) don't do that.

413
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:14,072
i've never(nunca) had to do that
for a job.

414
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,206
i know, i know.

415
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,942
you know(conhecer) i'd kill for dc,

416
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:21,045
but there's no way
i'm showing you my hotel room.

417
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,048
<i>this is gonna(vai) ruin my career.</i>

418
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,351
well, now i feel(sentir) like(como) a creep.

419
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:31,456
no.
no, you're so not.

420
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,058
<i>fucking creep.</i>

421
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,063
they fired(disparamos) me.

422
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,767
i'm a lousy reporter
apparently. assholes.

423
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,048
<i>she proved
what they(elas) wanted(desejado) her to prove.</i>

424
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:50,942
no one really(verdade) wins
by suing fox news.

425
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:53,010
it's been(estive) our experience

426
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,346
that once(uma vez) you go public
in your(seu) job,

427
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,117
no one will(vai) hire you.

428
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,185
if you're able
to stick it out at fox,

429
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:02,286
gather more(mais) evidence,

430
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:07,258
you might be able to sue
ailes himself instead of fox.

431
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,425
and that(este) is why i'm here.

432
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,462
because marty hyman told(contado) me
that over(sobre) here(aqui) in new jersey,

433
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:16,067
i can avoid arbitration
by suing roger personally.

434
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,269
he says(diz) that(este) you've managed
to change the law,

435
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:19,937
and that(este) we could
call other(de outros) women

436
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,404
and show(mostrar) a pattern.

437
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,274
will other(de outros) women(mulheres) come(venha) forward?

438
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,541
yes, they(elas) will.

439
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,943
you live and work(trabalhos) in new york.

440
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:28,913
roger has a house
in bergen county

441
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:30,782
where he stays
when he can't make(fazer) it upstate.

442
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,251
you do
your homework, ms. carlson.

443
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,920
no fingerprints.

444
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:38,189
that's how much i practiced
the violin as a child.

445
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:40,057
if roger finds out
you came(veio) to us,

446
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,102
he won't just(somente) fire you.

447
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,160
mmm.

448
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:45,396
he will(vai) bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

449
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,999
he will(vai) attack you personally.

450
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,943
these men, they(elas) care
more about(cerca de) their(deles) reputations

451
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,102
than they(elas) do money.

452
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:52,336
roger won't stop.

453
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:53,947
- oh, i know. mmm-hmm.
- you know(conhecer) that.

454
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:56,541
colleagues you admire
will say publicly

455
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,576
you're a superior,
ambitious woman

456
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,979
who's suing
because her career stalled.

457
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:03,047
let 'em.

458
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:07,585
okay.

459
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,887
if we work(trabalhos) hard,
you might be lucky enough

460
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,523
to watch
the most(a maioria) powerful man in tv

461
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,358
go after(depois de) you
with everything he's got.

462
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,896
thank you.

463
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,334
i'm telling you,
other women(mulheres) will(vai) come(venha) forward.

464
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,237
let's hope.

465
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,105
frankly,
i think(pensar) you have(ter) a gap

466
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:30,174
in the network, mr. shine.

467
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:33,511
there are millions of young
conservatives in this(isto) country.

468
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:36,414
i mean, you can look(olhar) at my
instagram account. there(lá) are.

469
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,516
they don't have(ter) a voice
on our network.

470
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,587
i see myself as an influencer
in the jesus space.

471
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,021
and don't get me wrong,

472
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,157
i've learned a ton
from gretchen,

473
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,291
i truly have, of course.

474
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,961
but no judgment here,

475
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:52,864
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

476
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,966
it's just(somente) not that(este) helpful
to her.

477
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,970
i mean, to be honest,
mr. shine,

478
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:01,339
she's sort of establishment.

479
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,074
with a capital e.

480
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:05,609
that's why i wanted
to talk(conversa) to you in private.

481
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:08,546
kayla, before(antes de) we move you up,

482
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:12,483
i want(querer) to ask you
something personal.

483
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:13,551
mmm.

484
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,921
what do you think(pensar) of our slogan,

485
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:18,223
"fair and balanced"?

486
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,224
i'm glad you asked.

487
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:23,094
look, our news(notícias) shows

488
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,128
and our opinion shows
are very(muito) different.

489
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:28,432
our news(notícias) is impartial,
it's top-of-the-line.

490
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,067
our opinion shows,

491
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,137
roger gave(deu) a voice
to people(pessoas) who didn't have(ter) one.

492
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,641
and he balanced
the american conversation.

493
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:40,511
so, our newspeople are fair.

494
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:45,149
our entertainers are a very
necessary form of balance.

495
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,588
attagirl. perfect.

496
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,100
but today,
we're sticking up for girls

497
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,394
on international day
of the girl.

498
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:59,297
and, for the first(primeiro) time
on cable news, here(aqui) i am,

499
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,632
makeup-free for a reason.

500
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:05,336
<i>tomorrow i'll be back
in my regular makeup.</i>

501
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,646
and i thank
the other(de outros) brave women

502
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,639
who came(veio) on today's show<i>
sans</i> makeup.

503
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:13,511
but let's continue to tell
our girls, "just be yourself."

504
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:14,645
shep.

505
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:15,689
- and clear.
- yes.

506
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,114
great show.

507
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,591
get me some(alguns) makeup.

508
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,351
i have(ter) some(alguns) bad news.

509
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,487
kayla is leaving us
for the asshole.

510
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,965
- o'reilly?
- mmm-hmm.

511
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,692
it is our highest-rated program.

512
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,327
and we can't be?

513
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,395
no, i believe
in<i> real story,</i> i do.

514
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:34,031
did you just(somente) see that(este) segment?
did you see it? did you see...

515
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:36,033
we're doing
something unique here.

516
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,969
mmm-hmm.
- together. all of us.

517
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,047
can you just...

518
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,137
sure.

519
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,205
listen to me.

520
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,109
i can get you
where you wanna(quer) be.

521
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,477
i can protect you.

522
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,721
just don't get ahead
of yourself.

523
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:50,047
you have(ter) a lot to learn.
i can teach you.

524
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,458
i'm not getting ahead
of myself, gretchen.

525
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,026
- i'm taking the next step.
- no. listen.

526
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,612
i learn by doing.

527
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,220
come on.
come on, please.

528
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:57,355
i'm confused.

529
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,190
you want(querer) me to pass on
a promotion

530
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:02,993
so you can help me
get the same promotion

531
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,537
- on a show(mostrar) with(com) worse ratings?
- no. i just...

532
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,697
i want(querer) a little loyalty.
i need(necessidade) loyalty.

533
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,099
women, together.

534
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:09,394
i'm loyal to the network.

535
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,701
all right.

536
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,303
it's not us versus them,
gretchen.

537
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,438
miss america.

538
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,473
roger.

539
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,108
hi, there.

540
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,210
- this(isto) is a treat.
- what(o que) the fuck(porra) are you doing?

541
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:22,112
a segment on how
we oversexualize women.

542
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,281
i mean, you said
be more(mais) myself, so, ta-da.

543
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:26,717
you know
what makeup does?

544
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,519
keeps everybody
from seeing you sweat.

545
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:31,188
well, it's... most(a maioria) of
the mean(significar) tweets that(este) i receive

546
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,623
are about(cerca de) my appearance,

547
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:34,258
so it is important
that we fight back

548
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,335
against this(isto) kind of bullying.

549
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,761
bullying isn't meanness.

550
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,429
bullying is
people with(com) more(mais) power

551
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,064
hitting people(pessoas) with(com) less.

552
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,799
these jackasses have(ter) cellphones.

553
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,568
you have(ter) a fucking(porra) tv show!

554
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:47,814
we have(ter) to fight
the objectification of women.

555
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,106
oh, bullshit.

556
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:51,742
listen, mouth shut, ears open.

557
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:53,711
nobody wants(quer) to watch
a middle-aged woman

558
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,312
sweat her way through menopause.

559
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:56,246
what?

560
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,516
not on
national fucking(porra) television!

561
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:01,051
thank you for the advice.

562
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,087
objectification.

563
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:09,660
all right.

564
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,095
gretchen, i really(verdade) appreciate...

565
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,130
shut up.

566
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:15,466
good luck.

567
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:24,742
drift.

568
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:27,178
go, go, go!

569
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:29,679
whoo! good(boa) one, honey.

570
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,182
ooh, ooh, ooh.

571
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:38,689
hey.

572
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,224
it's a zoo here.

573
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:41,537
the phone's ringing
off the hook.

574
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,261
anyone care
he called(chamado) me a bimbo?

575
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:45,362
not really.

576
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:46,474
he tweeted the<i> gq</i> photo.

577
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,598
<i>i saw.</i>

578
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,467
<i>- and?</i>
- torn.

579
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,137
god, i'd love(amar) to be slut-shamed.

580
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,573
gil wants(quer) to ask again
if we should(devemos) make(fazer) a statement.

581
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,842
no. no response. zero.

582
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:01,279
doug just(somente) lost.
i gotta(preciso) go.

583
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,415
next time, honey.

584
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,583
nice.

585
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:06,644
good game.

586
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:07,718
trump, '16.

587
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:10,588
excuse me.

588
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,123
you talk(conversa) to my wife again,

589
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:13,691
i will(vai) beat you
to a fucking(porra) pulp.

590
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,695
- that(este) was weird.
- mmm-hmm.

591
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,465
you're getting some(alguns) action.

592
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:22,600
oh, really?

593
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,246
oh, man.

594
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,848
asshole.

595
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:39,416
you don't have(ter) to worry
about trump.

596
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,285
you're tougher
than all those guys, okay?

597
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:42,495
you just(somente) gotta(preciso) worry
about the crazies.

598
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,897
- i can handle a few crazies.
- i know.

599
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,022
mommy.

600
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,324
trump will(vai) stop(pare) once(uma vez) he feels
he's won the argument.

601
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:48,826
i feel(sentir) like(como) he's less interested

602
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,162
in winning the argument

603
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:54,298
than just(somente) having the argument
with you in public

604
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:56,167
to prove he can
take on the establishment.

605
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,835
i'm not the establishment.

606
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:01,172
honey, get real.
you are the establishment now.

607
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:02,673
- mommy!
- not yet!

608
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:08,612
you do understand
i have(ter) to be above this, right?

609
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:10,347
i have(ter) to be an anchor(âncora) first,
then a woman.

610
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,682
you know(conhecer) the entire country

611
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:14,385
is talking
about your(seu) period right(direito) now?

612
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:16,353
- mommy!
- what?

613
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:18,222
- there's a man.

- yardley!
- look. he's right(direito) there.

615
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,501
- yardley, where(onde) is he?
- look. there(lá) he is.

616
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:22,735
oh, jesus.
he's got a fucking(porra) camera!

617
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,794
come here, honey.

618
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:24,904
no, no, no!
don't open the door.

619
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:26,272
they can't sell them
if we're inside.

620
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:27,631
get out. get out of here! go!

621
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:28,666
are you okay?

622
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,602
what were(eram) you guys(pessoal) doing?

623
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:35,806
- mommy and daddy?
- mmm-hmm.

624
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,442
um...
it was a crossword...

625
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:40,578
mommy was just(somente) taking
a quick little nap.

626
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,446
- quick one.
- it wasn't that(este) quick.

627
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:45,849
i'm gonna(vai) have(ter) to
call roger about(cerca de) security.

628
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,527
<i>it's as clear(claro) as a bell</i>

629

634
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,829
<i>this woman(mulher) was once(uma vez) pretty,</i>

<i>she snorts her insults
at america...</i>

639

roger!

640
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,481
<i>and, as i say, it's now
the portrait of dorian kelly,</i>

641
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:09,907
<i>not the portrait of dorian gray.</i>

642
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,377
give me a day to figure out
how we hit trump(trunfo) back.

643
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,511
stop by later.

644
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,347
i don't want(querer) my kids
hearing this(isto) crap.

645
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,949
ignore the damn morons.

646
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,451
i'm old, fat, and ugly.

647
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,853
christ,
they call(chamar) me jabba the hutt.

648
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:27,324
hemophilia swells my joints.
can't exercise.

649
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:29,627
i feel(sentir) fine,
but i look(olhar) like(como) shit.

650
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,929
i look(olhar) the opposite
of how i feel.

651
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:35,233
do i let it affect me?
no, i do not.

652
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,435
<i>this isn't entirely true.</i>

653
00:25:38,468 --> 00:25:39,870
<i>roger is also fat</i>

654
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:41,538
<i>because he'll get
a room-service menu</i>

655
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:42,640
<i>and order page two.</i>

656
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:44,708
no goddamn(maldito) orange on fox!

657
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:46,542
<i>but he cares a lot about(cerca de) looks.</i>

658
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:47,845
fucking idiots.

659
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,780
let's turn our attention
to south korea.

660
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:50,948
south korean officials say

661
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,717
talks with(com) the north have
adjourned until tomorrow...

662
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,019
<i>early on, he realized</i>

663
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:57,054
<i>for a network(rede) to stay on
24 hours a day,</i>

664
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:59,656
<i>you need(necessidade) something
to hold an audience.</i>

665
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,858
joining me to discuss

666
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:02,660
the korean peninsula
is seth choy...

667
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:05,561
<i>that something(alguma coisa) is legs.</i>

668
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,464
there's a reason
for clear(claro) desks.

669
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:11,402
we need(necessidade) you in a shorter dress.

670
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:12,545
<i>but you know
that they're gonna(vai) take...</i>

671
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,571
wide shot! wider!

672
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:16,373
go to the wide shot!

673
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:18,075
i want(querer) to see her goddamn(maldito) legs.

674
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:20,010
why the fuck
do you think(pensar) i hired her?

675
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,421
<i>but this(isto) might
be seen by racial activists</i>

676
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:22,746
<i>purely through the racial prism.</i>

677
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:28,085
uh, stand up and give(dar) me a spin.

678
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:29,297
really?

679
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,521
yeah, it's a visual medium.

680
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,662
yeah.
that's good. sit down.

681
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:40,531
i support the wall. i do.

682
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:42,700
but mass deportations, come(venha) on.

683
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:43,801
that'll never(nunca) work

684
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:46,036
because of the 14th amendment.
you want(querer) me to quote it?

685
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,570
"if you were(eram) born in america,

686
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,573
"you're an american, period.
period."

687
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:51,541
get me
a demographically friendly

688
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,477
hispanic woman(mulher) on immigration.

689
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,879
but, hey, she needs to be
very demographically friendly.

690
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:59,450
okay. uh, new girl's up.
kayla.

691
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,985
hi, sir.

692
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:04,054
so, i was listening to
rush limbaugh this(isto) morning.

693
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,924
he said(disse) something(alguma coisa) kind of cool
about anthony weiner.

694
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,960
how he's an exhibitionist
in every(todo) aspect

695
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:12,663
of how he presents himself
politically.

696
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:13,731
oh, my god.

697
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,632
is she the best
you can do?

698
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:18,769
bill shine asked us
to give(dar) her a try, so...

699
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:21,972
okay, let's not lose
focus. back(de volta) to immigration.

700
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,141
oh, my gosh.

701
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:25,541
i can't get fired.

702
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:28,512
this is the only(só) job
i have(ter) ever(sempre) wanted.

703
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:31,749
i don't wanna(quer) be on tv,
i wanna(quer) be on fox.

704
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,177
uh-huh.

705
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,618
my family, every(todo) day,

706
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,054
every holiday,
especially holidays,

707
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:38,522
they watch fox news.

708
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,391
we're like(como) addicts.

709
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:41,724
fox is how we do church.

710
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:43,035
you know(conhecer) when(quando) they(elas) made
the corner logo turn...

711
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,160
the bug.

712
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,763
because folks had "fox"
burned into their(deles) tv screens?

713
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:47,898
that's us.

714
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:49,500
kayla, you're not getting fired.

715
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:50,968
he cannot scale his anger.

716
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,636
he's a perpetual
outrage machine.

717
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,872
that's why crazies love(amar) him.
no offense to your(seu) family.

718
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:57,174
you want(querer) to do the folders?
no crying at fox.

719
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:58,409
no crying.

720
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:03,647
let me explain
your mistake here.

721
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,649
so, rush is on hannity's team.

722
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:07,818
they're the competition.
they're gop party hacks.

723
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,420
so, he thinks
he's way ahead of them,

724
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,655
so steal from(a partir de) drudge
and breitbart, not talk(conversa) radio.

725
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:12,623
okay.

726
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,524
also, stop(pare) worrying
if the story's legit.

727
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:15,592
if you can't source it,

728
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,528
just go with,
"some are saying."

729
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:18,629
seriously?

730
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:21,464
you have(ter) to adopt

731
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,100
the mentality of
an irish street cop.

732
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,136
the world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

733
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:27,571
minorities are criminals,

734
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:29,440
sex is sick, but interesting.

735
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,841
ask yourself, "what would
scare my grandmother,

736
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,777
"or piss off my grandfather?"

737
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,446
and that's a fox story.
are you writing this(isto) down?

738
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,647
oh, it makes so much sense.

739
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,025
- frighten, titillate.
- right.

740
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,219
frighten, titillate.
frighten, titillate.

741
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:43,619
when you're starting the story,

742
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:44,931
you need(necessidade) to start
with a clear(claro) villain.

743
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:48,759
liberal judge, pinhead mayor,

744
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:49,870
vermont, hollywood.

745
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,994
uh-huh.

746
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:52,696
conservatives want(querer) to conserve.

747
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:53,774
uh-huh.

748
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,865
you're the last defense

749
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,002
against jesus-hating,
trans-loving,

750
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:02,639
clinton-controlled
armageddon, baby.

751
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,608
oh, come(venha) on.

752
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:07,511
you do believe
some of that, right?

753
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,113
yeah.

754
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:11,615
uh...

755
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:19,523
that's quite a face
you have.

756
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:21,091
really?

757
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:22,827
thank you.

758
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,195
i'm drunk.

759
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:26,697
i'm drunk as well.

760
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:36,207
you have(ter) a hillary poster
in your(seu) house.

761
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:38,742
i guess i do.

762
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:42,579
okay, my parents
would be horrified

763
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:43,981
if i went home(casa) with(com) a democrat.

764
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,118
the lesbianism, however?

765
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:49,753
oh, i'm not a lesbian.

766
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,788
i'm not a democrat.

767
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:56,160
i just(somente) have(ter) two giant
hillary posters in my kitchen.

768
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:59,530
as a joke, though, right?

769
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:02,533
no. that's who
i'd like(como) to be the president.

770
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,301
are you serious?

771
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,904
i'm a closeted democrat.

772
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:08,539
at fox news?

773
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,240
oh, my god.
i thought that(este) you knew that.

774
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:13,143
no, i didn't know(conhecer) that.
does anyone know(conhecer) that?

775
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:15,746
can you not tell?
you can't tell(dizer) anyone.

776
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,619
- of course i won't tell.
- no, i'm so serious.

777
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,817
- can i ask something?
- mmm-hmm.

778
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:23,220
why do you work(trabalhos) at fox?

779
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,791
why don't you work
at msnbc or something?

780
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:32,029
i think(pensar) i, like,
thrive in toxic environments.

781
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:34,198
i never(nunca) know
if you're kidding or not.

782
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:35,933
i am kidding.

783
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,135
i applied everywhere

784
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,304
and i got a job at fox.

785
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,573
and i keep(guarda) applying
to other(de outros) places

786
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:45,576
and they(elas) keep(guarda) not taking me
because i work(trabalhos) at fox.

787
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,613
oh, my gosh.

788
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:52,081
it's okay.

789
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:54,651
one day i'm gonna(vai) be free.

790
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:55,819
what? it's not that(este) bad.

791
00:30:55,852 --> 00:30:59,056
if you're gay, it's pretty bad.

792
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:02,024
well, yeah, you don't
wanna be gay at fox.

793
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:05,695
you work(trabalhos) for bill(projeto de lei) o'reilly
and you have(ter) a hillary poster?

794
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:06,664
you do know(conhecer) he likes to

795
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,699
call up female producers
and whack off, right?

796
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:09,800
bill?

797
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,201
yes, bill.

798
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:12,335
no.

799
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,347
you haven't heard(ouvi) about
the andrea mackris lawsuit?

800
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:15,466
no.

801
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,607
oh, my god.

802
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,175
this should(devemos) be
in the welcome packet.

803
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,677
she was one of
his associate producers.

804
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,846
he took her, and only(só) her,

805
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,323
to the republican
national convention.

806
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,049
called her up at 11:00,

807
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:27,050
touching himself

808
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,052
and telling her
what he wanted(desejado) to do to her

809
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,787
with the old falafel.

810
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,022
are you kidding?

811
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,825
it's on the internet.

812
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:38,829
and then, quote, "using
a vibrator upon himself."

813
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:42,099
like, he brought a vibrator
from home(casa) to the convention?

814
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:43,400
yes, well, you have(ter) to bring

815
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:44,877
a vibrator from(a partir de) home
to the convention.

816
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:50,007
the question is, what(o que) does
a man do with(com) a vibrator?

817
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:54,678
do you place it
alongside the shaft?

818
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:01,351
i don't wanna(quer) hear that.

819
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:02,953
"fucking die, bitch."

820
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:05,822
"if i see you,
you better(melhor) run."

821
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,860
"i wouldn't be sleeping
too soundly if i were(eram) you."

822
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:11,895
trump's lit the torches.

823
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:14,297
you're getting security tonight.

824
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,367
all i want(querer) is for this
to go away, roger.

825
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,336
look, every(todo) general in history

826
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:21,639
has gone into battle
feeling the same.

827
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:25,909
right.

828
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,980
i'll read a statement
at the top, saying,

829
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:33,050
"yes, trump(trunfo) is attacking me,
but i'm not going(vai) to respond."

830
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,718
any defense will(vai) come(venha) from(a partir de) you.

831
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:39,990
not right(direito) now.

832
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,960
you set a record
on viewer email.

833
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:44,994
let me guess.

834
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:47,297
none of it on my side.

835
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:48,999
no.

836
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:50,801
our audience loves trump.

837
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,970
a hell of a lot more
than the murdochs realize.

838
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:55,706
more than(do que) trump(trunfo) knows.

839
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,842
he's tweeting we made(fez) peace.

840
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,044
he'll come(venha) on<i> fox & friends</i>
tomorrow.

841
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:03,046
he needs us.
we need(necessidade) him.

842
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,415
it's got nothing(nada) to do with(com) you.

843
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,352
all right. it's late.

844
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,055
i have(ter) dogs to feed.

845
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,306
just to be clear,

846
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,810
i will(vai) not be
kissing trump's ass at 9:00.

847
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:36,880
we fight
tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

848
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,461
can i see
that statement again, bill?

849
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,365
heard there(lá) was a dust-up
involving yours truly

850
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:57,768
and presidential contender
donald trump.

851
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,170
how you doing, megyn?

852
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,007
hanging in there.

853
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,044
give him hell, megyn.

854
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,194
<i>okay, quiet on the set.</i>

855
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:18,756
<i>we go live in five, four,
three, two...</i>

856
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,801
i just(somente) got back
from a weekend at the beach

857
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:22,902
with my husband
and my three kids.

858
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:24,837
did anything(nada) happen
in the news(notícias) while i was gone?

859
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:26,305
you may have(ter) heard

860
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:28,164
there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

861
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:30,333
and presidential contender
donald trump.

862
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:32,436
mr. trump(trunfo) was upset
with a question i asked...

863
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:36,106
oh, cute baby.

864
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:38,809
i gotta(preciso) say,
i can't stand your(seu) show.

865
00:34:39,274 --> 00:34:40,410
oh.

866
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,044
you guys(pessoal) at fox,

867
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,182
you're doing(fazendo) terrible things
to our country.

868
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:47,084
well, i hope
that makes you feel(sentir) better.

869
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:50,353
how you treat
people you disagree with

870
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:52,222
says everything about(cerca de) you.

871
00:35:00,496 --> 00:35:03,166
<i>you know, i mean, jesus was
a white man too, you know?</i>

872
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,867
<i>it's like,
he was an historical figure.</i>

873
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,145
<i>i mean,
that's a verifiable fact.</i>

874
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:08,438
<i>as is santa. i just(somente) want(querer) the
kids watching to know(conhecer) that.</i>

875
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,074
<i>but my point is,
how do you just(somente) revise it</i>

876
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:12,876
<i>and change santa
from white to black?</i>

877
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,709
<i>i mean, you can't. not really.</i>

878
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:19,583
wow.

879
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:21,351
nice dress.

880
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:23,887
i hope you don't
wear that(este) to sunday service.

881
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,921
please. i have(ter) church jeans,

882
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:28,325
so i can hold a latte
on my knee.

883
00:35:29,893 --> 00:35:31,461
oh, my god. kayla.

884
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:33,063
- did you see this?
- what?

885
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:38,936
i'm a creep.

886
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:41,281
that is gross.

887
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,439
i know.

888
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:45,175
i love(amar) that.

889
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,445
are you crazy?

890
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,614
what?

891
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:52,850
that's my friend from(a partir de) college.

892
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:55,385
i'm just(somente) looking out for you.

893
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:56,952
who are you stalking?

894
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:57,988
no one.

895
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:13,871
i feel(sentir) for you.

896
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:16,506
that show.

897
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:19,175
oh, his bark is worse
than his bite.

898
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,610
well, i work(trabalhos) for roger.

899
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:23,180
we have(ter) two, three
and four-donut days.

900
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,116
sugar does(faz) make(fazer) everybody(todo o mundo) crazy.

901
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,450
no, these(esses) aren't donuts he eats.

902
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:29,952
they're donuts he throws.
at somebody.

903
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:36,393
no, he's a pussycat.

904
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:39,462
come say hi. we're always
looking for on-air talent.

905
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:41,198
- oh, really?
- mmm.

906
00:36:42,565 --> 00:36:43,566
now?

907
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:46,703
sure.

908
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,510
that's roger's private elevator.

909
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:56,914
hang on a sec.

910
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:07,624
mmm-hmm.

911
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:09,993
hello.

912
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:11,038
ah, have(ter) a seat.

913
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,095
thank you.

914
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,266
liberals don't get megyn.

915
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:19,636
she's a star not because
she thinks santa's white,

916
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,671
- but because(porque) she'll say it.
- that's right.

917
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:24,173
yeah, few have(ter) courage
in the spotlight.

918
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:25,642
it's powerful to watch.

919
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,244
and she went up 30%
that quarter.

920
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:30,347
well, that, too.

921
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,583
all audiences want
is authenticity.

922
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:35,318
- mmm.
- for 200 years,

923
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:36,686
santa's a fat white guy.

924
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,454
they think(pensar) santa,

925
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,565
- that's what(o que) they(elas) see.
- right.

926
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,424
you want(querer) to
change that? fine.

927
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:44,527
let's discuss it without you
calling my people(pessoas) racist.

928
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,661
exactly.

929
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:48,465
a liberal is somebody
who wants(quer) to live in a future

930
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:50,499
that he is too lazy

931
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:53,403
or too arrogant
to actually create.

932
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:56,639
well, in my family,
santa's always(sempre) been(estive) white

933
00:37:56,672 --> 00:38:00,076
and, according to my
granddaddy, a communist.

934
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:03,579
so, that's my family.

935
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:08,051
so, what(o que) can i do
for you, kayla?

936
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:10,787
why did you drop by to see me?

937
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,789
well, the thing(coisa) is, sir,

938
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,191
i actually started on-air
during college

939
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:17,327
in central florida. weather.

940
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,162
i want(querer) to convince you

941
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:23,133
that that(este) is where(onde) i belong, mr. ailes.

942
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,468
i think(pensar) i'd be freakin'
phenomenal on your(seu) network.

943
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,205
well, it's
mr. murdoch's air,

944
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:32,709
but i did create it.
i do run it.

945
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:33,777
right.

946
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,245
you have(ter) a pretty face.

947
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:40,083
here, uh, stand up
and give(dar) me a twirl.

948
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,217
now?

949
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,319
yeah.
just a quick spin.

950
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:44,788
oh. sure.

951
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:56,266
that's very(muito) good.

952
00:38:57,366 --> 00:39:02,105
now, uh, pull your(seu) dress up
and let me see your(seu) legs.

953
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,711
um...

954
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,788
it's a visual medium, kayla.

955
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:20,824
come on.

956
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:30,767
higher.

957
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,552
come on. higher.

958
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:12,843
that's fine, kayla.

959
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,481
why don't you sit down?

960
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:29,858
thank you.

961
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:30,894
mmm-hmm.

962
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:34,463
you have(ter) a great(excelente) body.

963
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:35,599
thank you.

964
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,139
mr. ailes...

965
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:47,177
i'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this...

966
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,238
no, no, of course.

967
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,312
to anyone.

968
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:50,747
i'm here(aqui) to help my employees,

969
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,958
not hurt them.

970
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,182
it would(seria) just(somente) sound...

971
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:56,186
anything that(este) happens here,
in this(isto) room,

972
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,389
is strictly between you and me.

973
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:00,601
okay.

974
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,825
of course, it cuts both ways.

975
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:04,628
i'm discreet,

976
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,298
but unforgiving.

977
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:20,710
success in
broadcast television

978
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:23,513
is hard.
it's arbitrary.

979
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:26,183
this is the most(a maioria) competitive
industry on earth.

980
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,885
you understand what(o que) i'm saying?

981
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,287
mmm-hmm.

982
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,322
we could(poderia) work(trabalhos) together.

983
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:37,527
i could(poderia) pluck you out
and move you

984
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,629
all the way
to the front of the line.

985
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:43,432
but i want(querer) something(alguma coisa) in return.

986
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:49,906
do you know(conhecer) what(o que) that(este) is, kayla?

987
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:55,612
loyalty.

988
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,583
i need(necessidade) to know
that you're loyal.

989
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:05,322
i need(necessidade) you to find(achar) a way to prove it.

990
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,024
mmm-hmm.

991
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:09,726
you think(pensar) about(cerca de) that, all right?

992
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:17,467
so, we'll talk(conversa) again?

993
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,338
faye can show(mostrar) you the way out.

994
00:42:21,837 --> 00:42:23,006
thank you, sir.

995
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:47,597
jess. jess.

996
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:55,671
something really(verdade) weird
just happened.

997
00:42:56,906 --> 00:43:00,576
i just(somente) went to say hi to...

998
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,514
i just... i met...
i was invited to meet roger.

999
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:07,617
i mean, nothing...

1000
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:10,386
nothing happened.

1001
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:11,621
kayla.

1002
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:15,391
it's actually better(melhor) for you

1003
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:16,760
if you don't involve me in this.

1004
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:21,464
um, 'cause they(elas) know
that we're friends.

1005
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:24,000
i'm sorry.

1006
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:25,935
okay.

1007
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:27,937
this place is crazy.

1008
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,382
no trump. no kkk.

1009
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:40,683

<i>his assistant's name is rhona.</i>

<i>the security guard is keith...</i>

1013
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:47,056

1014
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:49,759
gil, last words?

1015
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,728
<i>yeah, don't piss him off.

1016
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,496
<i>good luck.</i>

00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:54,831

1018
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:07,268
are you
happy now, bitch?

1019
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,148
<i>during the day,

00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,916
well, what(o que) do you think?

1038
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,720
i think(pensar) you're too solicitous.

1039
00:44:50,753 --> 00:44:52,588
thank you.

1040
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:54,824
but this(isto) once, i can handle
a straight-up positive.

1041
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:56,559
- i'm sorry.
- yeah.

1042
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:59,961
he attacks you
for a year straight

1043
00:44:59,995 --> 00:45:02,865
and you let him off
with a fucking(porra) "oops."

1044
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:04,967
what?
i don't let him off.

1045
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,538
i confront him.
i used donald trump.

1046
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,540
honey, you absolved him.

1047
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:11,874
doug, there(lá) are internal

1048
00:45:11,907 --> 00:45:13,609
political pressures
at play here(aqui) as well.

1049
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:15,478
yeah, yeah. i bet.
i get it, gil.

1050
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:16,955
you know(conhecer) what,
can we have(ter) a second, guys?

1051
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:18,148
please.

1052
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:24,620
i'm not trying to be critical.
i just...

1053
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:26,689
well, you are.
i made(fez) this(isto) go away.

1054
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:29,859
i stopped his
harassing bullshit. for us.

1055
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:32,161
i never(nunca) asked you to do that.

1056
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:33,463
he is going(vai) to be

1057
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:35,097
the republican(republicano) candidate
for president.

1058
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,965
i'm a news(notícias) anchor.
i need(necessidade) access to him.

1059
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:39,669
you need(necessidade) access?
at what(o que) fucking(porra) price?

1060
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:43,639
at what(o que) price? the price
of our apartment. my salary.

1061
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:46,009
that pays our fucking(porra) bills.

1062
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:57,920
- look. for the record...
- no. you know(conhecer) what?

1063
00:45:57,953 --> 00:45:59,489
it's been(estive) a shitty year!

1064
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,558
really fucking(porra) shitty year,

1065
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:04,760
and i'm allowed to want(querer) it over.

1066
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:06,996
you are.

1067
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:10,599
fuck.

1068
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:13,135
so, what(o que) i'm saying(dizendo) is,
do we really(verdade) need(necessidade) ar-15s

1069
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:14,769
to be able to hunt deer,

1070
00:46:14,803 --> 00:46:15,838
protect our families?

1071
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:20,175
i'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

1072
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:22,153
some of these(esses) mass shootings
would have(ter) been(estive) less deadly

1073
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:23,613
if that(este) had been(estive) the case.

1074
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:26,916
but i'm also with
the majority today,

1075
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:30,253
taking a stand against
semiautomatic assault weapons.

1076
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:32,130

hannity tweeted, "i talked to
hundreds of women(mulheres) at fox this(isto) week,

1232
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:17,473
"both on air and off.

1233
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:19,141
"they say it all bs."

1234
00:56:19,174 --> 00:56:20,685
- brit hume, too.
- brit?

1235
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:22,678
"why didn't gretchen
quit and sue

1236
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:24,713
"instead of suing
only after(depois de) she got fired?

1237
00:56:24,746 --> 00:56:25,786
"why didn't she complain?"

1238
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:27,483
why didn't she complain?
really?

1239
00:56:27,516 --> 00:56:29,151
he means the anonymous hotline.

1240
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:30,586
- there's a hotline?
- yeah.

1241
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,720
i did
the harassment seminar twice.

1242
00:56:32,754 --> 00:56:33,831
i never(nunca) heard(ouvi) about(cerca de) a hotline.

1243
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:35,090
because it's bullshit.

1244
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:37,825
they have(ter) a contractual right
to monitor our communications.

1245
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:41,330
a hotline in this(isto) building
is like(como) a complaint box in occupied paris.

1246
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:45,733
it's like(como) we're telling women,
"go on. speak up for yourself.

1247
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:48,770
"just know(conhecer) the entire network
is with(com) roger."

1248
00:56:48,803 --> 00:56:50,639
no one will(vai) believe you.

1249
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:52,374
they'll call(chamar) you a liar.

1250
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:55,477
oh, and as for your(seu) career,
you want(querer) assignments and air time?

1251
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,845
go ahead.
call the paranoid man

1252
00:56:56,878 --> 00:56:58,412
who decides your(seu) salary
a pervert,

1253
00:56:58,446 --> 00:57:01,150
and do that(este) on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls.

1254
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,819
on a phone(telefone) he has
a contractual right(direito) to record.

1255
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:06,421
jesus fucking(porra) christ,
do you think(pensar) women(mulheres) are idiots?

1256
00:57:06,454 --> 00:57:08,157
it's like
somebody stripped you naked

1257
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,567
and they(elas) want(querer) you
to walk through this(isto) office

1258
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:11,193
just to fucking(porra) prove it.

1259
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:12,795
okay.

1260
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,832
can i see you for a minute?

1261
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:27,709
what the fuck(porra) was that?

1262
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:29,478
i don't know, but i liked it.

1263
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,653
i won't call(chamar) you a feminist,

1264
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:39,720
but say there's a spectrum,
you are...

1265
00:57:39,754 --> 00:57:41,390
roger harassed me.

1266
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:45,394
ten years(anos) ago.

1267
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:49,631
i had turned down
a law-firm partnership

1268
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:52,700
for an entry-level job
here at fox.

1269
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:56,472
roger would(seria) call(chamar) me up to
new york to dangle prospects.

1270
00:57:58,406 --> 00:57:59,642
i wanted(desejado) his help.

1271
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:04,446
did you

1272
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,715
do anything?

1273
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:09,585
no.

1274
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:11,487
will you talk?

1275
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:16,258
- megyn?
- i don't know.

1276
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,392
i don't know.

1277
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:22,231
i mean, going(vai) on the record...

1278
00:58:23,598 --> 00:58:26,268
jesus.

1279
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:28,870
it's basically admitting
you're the weak one in the herd.

1280
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:31,940
no, it's admitting
you're the hot one.

1281
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:33,609
it has nothing
to do with(com) that, gil.

1282
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:35,377
- say women.
- oh, my god.

1283
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,645
look, there(lá) is a reason

1284
00:58:36,678 --> 00:58:38,480
certain women(mulheres) can defend roger.

1285
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:40,716
if i report this(isto) and it leaks,

1286
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:43,352
it will(vai) follow me
for the rest of my career.

1287
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:44,895
i don't wanna(quer) be defined
by roger's bullshit.

1288
00:58:44,919 --> 00:58:48,423
i refuse to be the fucking(porra) poster girl
for sexual harassment.

1289
00:58:48,456 --> 00:58:51,392
he can't still be doing
that crap, right?

1290
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:52,586
i mean, the man has a walker.

1291
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:55,530
- viagra?
- gil.

1292
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:57,967
help me here.

1293
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,003
please. how do i play this?

1294
00:59:02,804 --> 00:59:06,275
well, you only(só) ask
when you already know.

1295
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:10,579
if i learned anything(nada) this(isto) year,

1296
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:11,789
it's to not get sucked
into a fight

1297
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:14,094
with someone who has better(melhor) reason
to be in it than(do que) you do.

1298
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:16,885
okay.

1299
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:19,755
okay.

1300
00:59:21,556 --> 00:59:23,392
so, what(o que) is it you wanna(quer) do?

1301
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:27,296
for right(direito) now, nothing.

1302
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:28,497
- good.
- good.

1303
00:59:50,518 --> 00:59:52,487
there she is.

1304
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,423
hi, roger.

1305
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:55,791
hello, sweetheart.

1306
00:59:57,959 --> 00:59:59,494
hi.

1307
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:00,529
sit, sit.

1308
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:04,700
- you've met mayor giuliani before?
- of course.

1309
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:06,702
there's
an internal investigation,

1310
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:08,704
but i'm not gonna(vai) wait(esperar) for it
to clear(claro) me.

1311
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:11,440
the republican(republicano) convention
is less than(do que) two weeks away.

1312
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:13,809
this is bullshit.
i'm gonna(vai) fight it.

1313
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:15,477
the charges are absurd.

1314
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,045
i'm in, roger.

1315
01:00:17,078 --> 01:00:19,681
i love(amar) that(este) fate has given me
a chance to repay you

1316
01:00:19,714 --> 01:00:21,416
for when(quando) i was
in intensive care.

1317
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:24,753
roger called(chamado) my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks.

1318
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:26,063
told them(eles) he'd put me on the air

1319
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:27,098
live from(a partir de) the hospital bed

1320
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:29,991
if they(elas) didn't fix
every stitch of damage done.

1321
01:00:30,024 --> 01:00:32,627
but i'm also here(aqui) as someone

1322
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,896
who has dealt with(com) this(isto) issue
for years,

1323
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:38,367
years on the side of women.

1324
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,668
i don't wanna(quer) see
sexual violence trivialized.

1325
01:00:40,702 --> 01:00:44,639
i don't wanna(quer) see it become
some damn political football.

1326
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:47,843
in that(este) spirit, i need(necessidade) to ask,

1327
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:50,679
will an investigation
find anything,

1328
01:00:50,712 --> 01:00:52,781
well, uncomfortable?

1329
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:57,786
well, define uncomfortable.

1330
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,121
roger, quote,

1331
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:00,722
"i think(pensar) you and i
should have(ter) had

1332
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:02,990
"a sexual relationship
a long time(tempo) ago.

1333
01:01:03,024 --> 01:01:04,559
"and then
you'd be good(boa) and better

1334
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:05,703
"and i'd be good(boa) and better."

1335
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,289
did you say that?

1336
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:08,897
no, i'm not a fool.

1337
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,800
"you missed your(seu) chance for me
to harass you"? come(venha) on.

1338
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,568
i think(pensar) they'll argue
it's solicitous.

1339
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:17,072
telling a woman(mulher) she was
fuckable "a long time(tempo) ago."

1340
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:18,774
who the hell thinks that(este) works?

1341
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:20,442
why's she suing, roger?

1342
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:23,044
gretchen is
a very(muito) competitive woman

1343
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:24,979
facing a severe
likability issue.

1344
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:29,751
one that(este) i shielded her from
for years.

1345
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:31,586
her career's over, i'm afraid.

1346
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:32,887
and she can't take
a joke.

1347
01:01:32,921 --> 01:01:34,856
roger is very(muito) salty.

1348
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:38,760
i find(achar) it amusing.
it's my fault. i encourage it.

1349
01:01:38,793 --> 01:01:41,963
james murdoch
could be behind this.

1350
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:44,132
his wife
openly supports hillary.

1351
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:46,034
and it could(poderia) go deeper.

1352
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:47,936
i have(ter) good(boa) reason to believe

1353
01:01:47,969 --> 01:01:50,070
that inside
the obama white house,

1354
01:01:50,104 --> 01:01:51,440
there have(ter) been(estive) discussions,

1355
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:53,442
on what(o que) level i do not know...

1356
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:56,177
of having me killed.

1357
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,463
oh, jesus.

1358
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:52,768
- hi, there.
- hey.

1359
01:02:54,903 --> 01:02:56,038
roger needs you.

1360
01:02:56,738 --> 01:02:58,674
your silence is being noticed.

1361
01:03:00,942 --> 01:03:02,844
well, the whole point
of an investigation

1362
01:03:02,877 --> 01:03:04,579
is to find(achar) the truth, jeanine.

1363
01:03:04,612 --> 01:03:06,681
until that(este) happens,
i don't have(ter) a lot to say.

1364
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:08,950
if this(isto) charge sticks,

1365
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:10,584
the working assumption will(vai) be,

1366
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:13,622
"every woman(mulher) at fox got down
on her knees."

1367
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:16,157
even you.

1368
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:18,159
if we sweep this(isto) thing
under the rug, jeanine,

1369
01:03:18,192 --> 01:03:19,794
and it happens again,

1370
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:21,296
under title seven,

1371
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:22,597
fox will(vai) be liable

1372
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,032
for compensatory
and punitive damages.

1373
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:26,701
that could(poderia) be
hundreds of millions.

1374
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:29,104
let's worry about(cerca de) the law
before we do the pr, okay?

1375
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:31,940
does roger want(querer) us?

1376
01:03:31,973 --> 01:03:34,743
yes. he's a man.

1377
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,212
he also gave(deu) us time.

1378
01:03:37,245 --> 01:03:39,180
he gave(deu) us opportunity.

1379
01:03:39,213 --> 01:03:41,216
we benefited
from that(este) kind of attention.

1380
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:46,588
i mean, jeanine pirro?

1381
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:49,324
she's the founding member
of team roger.

1382
01:03:49,357 --> 01:03:50,601
you're not answering your(seu) phone.

1383
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:51,860
no, i'm holding it.

1384
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:53,728
okay, well, everybody's
still looking for you.

1385
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:57,165
- where(onde) were(eram) any of these(esses) people(pessoas) to defend me from(a partir de) trump, hmm?
- excuse me.

1386
01:03:57,198 --> 01:03:58,567
bill shine told(contado) them(eles) not to.

1387
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,635
what the fuck?

1388
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:02,304
our boss.

1389
01:04:02,337 --> 01:04:04,039
why are you guys(pessoal) in the hall?

1390
01:04:04,072 --> 01:04:05,673
i got a call(chamar) from(a partir de) roger's lawyer

1391
01:04:05,707 --> 01:04:07,842
saying to, quote, "relax."

1392
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,915
they're convincing rupert
to limit the investigation

1393
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:11,346
to gretchen and her team.

1394
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:13,648
that's only(só) five or six women.

1395
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:15,083
are you gonna(vai) let that(este) happen?

1396
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:25,726
i like(como) roger. i do.

1397
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,695
i know.

1398
01:04:26,728 --> 01:04:29,363
even if he can be controlling
and vindictive.

1399
01:04:29,397 --> 01:04:32,067
those sins aren't really
the problem, meg.

1400
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,102
i mean, there(lá) were
hundreds of stories

1401
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:35,870
of roger paying
an employee's rehab,

1402
01:04:35,903 --> 01:04:38,340
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll.

1403
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:41,041
you remember when(quando) shep came(veio) out.

1404
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:42,310
all roger said(disse) was,

1405
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:43,420
"i don't care
where you put your(seu) pecker,

1406
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:45,647
"as long as you don't tell(dizer) me
where to put mine."

1407
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,249
again, not the most(a maioria) redeeming.

1408
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:51,786
he promoted me,
he looked past the rejection,

1409
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:54,889
he looked past the risk
of this(isto) exact conversation.

1410
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:56,925
he handed me the power
to hurt him.

1411
01:05:26,387 --> 01:05:27,582
morning.

1412
01:05:27,606 --> 01:05:28,823
<i>hi, megyn.</i>

1413
01:05:28,856 --> 01:05:31,959

1417

no, why? gerson, we can
handle this(isto) ourselves.

1418

1421
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:50,078
mr. giuliani,
you're an old friend of roger.

1422

<i>sharing information with(com) you</i>

1424

subject to discovery.

1427
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:01,889
i understand.
you get me a waiver.

1428
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:03,233
i will(vai) not structure
this investigation

1429
01:06:03,257 --> 01:06:05,959
so roger isn't perceived of

<i>you want(querer) him to look(olhar) guilty?</i>

1509
01:09:22,924 --> 01:09:23,935
that doesn't prove much.

1510
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,126

does roger seem like(como) a guy
who would(seria) get off

1514
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,568
on that(este) particular
power dynamic? yes.

1515

a guy who maybe thinks

1516
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:38,606
oral doesn't
really count? maybe.

these incidents all happened
before fox started.

1523
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,354
- should(devemos) that(este) matter?
- no.

1524
01:09:54,388 --> 01:09:55,390
yes.

1527
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:07,335
he asked me to encourage women

1528
01:10:07,368 --> 01:10:08,835
who have(ter) claims to come(venha) forward.

1529
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:12,173
you remember what(o que) happened
last time(tempo) you got between rupert and roger?

1530
01:10:14,342 --> 01:10:16,511
before i speak out,

1531
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:19,381
i need(necessidade) to know(conhecer) if this(isto) happened
to other(de outros) women(mulheres) at fox.

1532
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:22,684
you understand that?

1533
01:10:25,152 --> 01:10:27,155
is this(isto) one
where you really(verdade) wanna(quer) know,

1534
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:29,357
or you wanna(quer) look(olhar) like

1535
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,959
you really(verdade) wanna(quer) know,
but don't?

1536
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,195
i really(verdade) wanna(quer) know.

1537
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:38,700
i'm not always(sempre) like(como) that.

1538
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:41,678
no one around here(aqui) believes

1539
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:43,972
roger would(seria) want
to harass gretchen.

1540
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:47,442
i will(vai) send you some(alguns) of
her soapy notes to roger.

1541
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:49,710
"last night
sandra filled in for megyn.

1542
01:10:49,744 --> 01:10:51,679
"why not me? smiley face."

1543
01:10:51,712 --> 01:10:55,116
who sends a harasser
a smiley face?

1544
01:10:55,149 --> 01:10:56,718
- martin.
- hey, nancy.

1545
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,553
- thanks for coming.
- of course.

1546
01:10:59,186 --> 01:11:01,356
hi, nancy. coffee?

1547
01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:02,958
thank you.

1548
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,461
so, what(o que) do you got?

1549
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:12,367
so, um, no one from(a partir de) fox
has come(venha) forward.

1550
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,735
no one?

1551
01:11:13,768 --> 01:11:15,036
rudi bakhtiar.

1552
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:19,272
but no one who's still there?

1553
01:11:19,306 --> 01:11:22,009
there's been(estive) nothing
but praise for roger.

1554
01:11:22,043 --> 01:11:24,212
except from(a partir de) megyn kelly.

1555
01:11:24,245 --> 01:11:25,380
she's been(estive) unusually silent.

1556
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,248
right. well,
something must've happened

1557
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:29,183
to megyn in the past with(com) roger.

1558
01:11:29,216 --> 01:11:31,753
she's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1559
01:11:31,786 --> 01:11:33,121
possibly.

1560
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:35,490
should you call?

1561
01:11:35,523 --> 01:11:38,526
tell her this(isto) is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1562
01:11:38,559 --> 01:11:40,528
megyn, share?

1563
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:42,497
no. she wouldn't do it.

1564
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,307
- what(o que) makes you say that?
- because(porque) i wouldn't.

1565
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:47,368
i mean, roger plays his women
off against(contra) each other.

1566
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:48,669
he's always(sempre) done it.
he'll say,

1567
01:11:48,702 --> 01:11:50,638
"megyn thinks that
lisa should(devemos) get your(seu) spot."

1568
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:53,141
or, "megyn suspects
that you're screwing cal."

1569
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:54,785
and then(então) he'll offer advice
on how to get back(de volta) at her,

1570
01:11:54,809 --> 01:11:56,010
as if you brought it up.

1571
01:11:56,044 --> 01:11:58,613
- she's renegotiating her deal.
- i can think(pensar) of roughly

1572
01:11:58,646 --> 01:12:01,315
15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

1573
01:12:01,348 --> 01:12:03,384
we do need(necessidade) some(alguns) collaboration.

1574
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:04,594
well,
that would(seria) certainly help

1575
01:12:04,618 --> 01:12:06,287
with the other(de outros) networks.

1576
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,156
oh, god. what?

1577
01:12:09,223 --> 01:12:10,258
what, marty?

1578
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:12,627
well, we've not had, um,

1579
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,430
a lot of incoming
job interests from(a partir de) them.

1580
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:18,298
what's not a lot?

1581
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:21,603
none.

1582
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:24,039
they're afraid of roger.

1583
01:12:24,872 --> 01:12:26,673
no.

1584
01:12:26,707 --> 01:12:28,810
no woman(mulher) gets(fica) to sue her boss.

1585
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,778
rule number one
of corporate america,

1586
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:32,247
you don't sue your(seu) boss.

1587
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:36,751
i jumped off a cliff.

1588
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,557
i thought one of them
would stand with(com) me.

1589
01:12:46,827 --> 01:12:48,463
- hey, mom.
- hey, we're home.

1590
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:50,731
god, uh... hey, honey.

1591
01:12:50,764 --> 01:12:52,633
there's a snack in the kitchen.

1592
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:53,835
- okay.
- thanks.

1593
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:00,241
we're gonna(vai) get him.

1594
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:04,611
megyn doesn't want
to release a statement.

1595
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:06,848
it could(poderia) be seen as
influencing the investigation.

1596
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:09,683
have her say that
to roger's face.

1597
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:13,321
look, let us know(conhecer) who else
hasn't spoken up for him,

1598
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:16,724
and maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

1599
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:19,794
no! jesus. we need
our anchors. we need(necessidade) her.

1600
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:22,230
let me talk(conversa) to her.

1601
01:13:22,263 --> 01:13:23,831
yes, please.

1602
01:13:23,864 --> 01:13:28,835
look, sweetheart. this(isto) is
an island of safety and truth.

1603
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:30,605
i wear(vestem) pants.

1604
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:32,874
no one has ever(sempre) told(contado) me
not to wear(vestem) pants.

1605
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:35,776
i wear(vestem) pants. i'd love(amar) to know
where that(este) came(veio) from.

1606
01:13:35,809 --> 01:13:37,345
it's obnoxious. it's toxic.

1607
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:40,448
we need(necessidade) everyone(todos) on team roger.

1608
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:42,250
everyone.

1609
01:13:42,283 --> 01:13:43,785
- hi.
- good(boa) morning.

1610
01:13:45,486 --> 01:13:49,891
come on. no one
makes me wear(vestem) short skirts.

1611
01:13:53,727 --> 01:13:55,530
he was the first
to put a female on

1612
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:57,298
as host of a prime-time show.

1613
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:59,367
roger ailes champions women.

1614
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,270
no. there(lá) is no leg cam.

1615
01:14:02,303 --> 01:14:05,239
no. could(poderia) you just
hold on for one sec?

1616
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:07,308
maggie? i have(ter) to
wear pants tomorrow.

1617
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:09,877
not without authorization from
the second(segundo) floor, you don't.

1618
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,655
we never(nunca) fitted her for pants!

1619
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,889
you can print
whatever story(história) you like,

1620
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:13,948
but there(lá) is no leg cam.

1621
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:15,349
- lily?
- hmm?

1622
01:14:15,382 --> 01:14:17,317
beth needs me to talk(conversa) to megyn.

1623
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:18,719
i'm gonna(vai) do an on-air statement

1624
01:14:18,752 --> 01:14:19,863
while all the fox women(mulheres) come(venha) out

1625
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:21,489
one by one behind me for roger.

1626
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:23,191
that will(vai) never(nunca) happen.

1627
01:14:24,658 --> 01:14:25,692
ains?

1628
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:35,536
well, you know(conhecer) why roger's got
that door blocking his office?

1629
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:37,838
well, yeah, 'cause
a bangladeshi from(a partir de) accounting

1630
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:39,540
wandered in one day by mistake.

1631
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:40,908
please.

1632
01:14:40,941 --> 01:14:41,876
it's so girls can come(venha) in

1633
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:43,589
from the back(de volta) elevator
and no one sees 'em.

1634
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:46,181
- really?
- mmm-hmm.

1635
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:48,583
we get talent
coming here(aqui) all the time

1636
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:50,351
looking to get their(deles) faces done.

1637
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:52,720
"i'm going(vai) to see roger.
i gotta(preciso) look(olhar) my best."

1638
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:53,788
yeah. one came(veio) back(de volta) out

1639
01:14:53,821 --> 01:14:56,224
with it rubbed off her nose
and chin.

1640
01:14:57,491 --> 01:14:58,693
who was that?

1641
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:04,932
my memory's horrible.

1642
01:15:04,965 --> 01:15:06,968
you should(devemos) go see janice
in weather.

1643
01:15:09,503 --> 01:15:11,739
i mean, nobody wants(quer) to talk.

1644
01:15:11,772 --> 01:15:13,134
can you blame them?

1645
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:14,542
no.

1646
01:15:14,575 --> 01:15:15,944
where'd you disappear to?

1647
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,347
i've got names.

1648
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,816

to have(ter) stories about(cerca de) roger.

1649
01:15:21,849 --> 01:15:23,451

1651
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:26,320
everybody confides in her.

1652
01:15:26,353 --> 01:15:27,922
nobody from(a partir de) weather
wants your(seu) job.

1653
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:28,999
what are you going
to do with(com) them?

1654
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:30,524
tell them(eles) this(isto) time's different.

1655
01:15:30,557 --> 01:15:31,668
- wait.
- no, don't wait.

1656
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:32,593
don't listen(ouvir) to him.

1657
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:35,329
listen... look, it's not only
your job here.

1658

anywhere. but we can't.

1662

1835
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:39,940
i need(necessidade) someone right(direito) now

1839
01:24:45,946 --> 01:24:47,882
and they're taking it

i...

1845
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:09,136
i did it. i gave(deu) in to him.

1849
01:25:22,115 --> 01:25:23,484
he kept saying...

1850
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:26,920
"good girl.

1851
01:25:26,953 --> 01:25:29,123
"that's a good(boa) girl.

1854
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:37,331
<i>he didn't even...</i>

1855
01:25:37,364 --> 01:25:38,598
didn't even(até) unbuckle.

01:25:39,599 --> 01:25:41,468
he couldn't get...

1857

<i>no, kayla.</i>

1859
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:58,252

01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:02,589
<i>i'm sorry.</i>

1861
01:26:06,259 --> 01:26:07,528
i better(melhor) go.

1862
01:26:09,629 --> 01:26:12,399
roger can sense
vulnerabilities.

1863
01:26:12,432 --> 01:26:15,902
in those days, our meetings
were career-strategy sessions

1864
01:26:15,936 --> 01:26:19,473
mixed with(com) good(boa) advice
and comments like...

1865
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:23,142
the most(a maioria) basic thing
is confidence.

1866
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:25,412
feel at home(casa) in your(seu) own skin.

1867
01:26:25,445 --> 01:26:27,948
if you're confident,
you're sexy.

1868
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:30,317
i'm sure(claro) you have
some sexy bras.

1869
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,152
i'd love(amar) to see you in those.

1870
01:26:35,522 --> 01:26:37,691
it was a cat-and-mouse game.

1871
01:26:37,724 --> 01:26:40,060
but he always(sempre) gave(deu) me
good advice,

1872
01:26:40,093 --> 01:26:41,395
and let me deflect,

1873
01:26:43,363 --> 01:26:44,899
tell him to dream on.

1874
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:49,136
the more(mais) i let him
get away with,

1875
01:26:51,304 --> 01:26:53,507
the more(mais) he pushed my buttons.

1876
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:57,177
<i>i don't know(conhecer) if women

men have(ter) that(este) killer instinct.

1878
01:27:01,681 --> 01:27:02,883
we do bad things.

1879
01:27:04,117 --> 01:27:06,053
and we do not
feel guilty about(cerca de) it.

1880
01:27:08,388 --> 01:27:12,192
how can i be sure
you have(ter) that(este) kind of drive?

1881
01:27:16,529 --> 01:27:18,432
finally, in january...

1882
01:27:18,465 --> 01:27:19,633
this is '06?

1883
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,935
yes.

1884
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,228
he grabbed me.

1885
01:27:50,697 --> 01:27:52,132
tried to kiss me.

1886
01:28:00,507 --> 01:28:02,476
i pushed him away twice.

1887
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,452
<i>as i was leaving, he asked,
"when's your(seu) contract up?"</i>

1888
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,537
after the third time, i left.

1889
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:33,507
and he never(nunca) tried
anything again?

1890
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:34,742
no.

1891
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:38,312
i ignored his calls.
stayed in dc.

1892
01:28:39,012 --> 01:28:40,547
two years(anos) later, i had a show.

1893
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:44,818
any long-term consequences?

1894
01:28:49,089 --> 01:28:50,324
yeah. um...

1896
01:29:00,867 --> 01:29:03,237
yes. why?

1897
01:29:04,337 --> 01:29:06,306

1963
01:31:42,362 --> 01:31:43,797
breitbart is saying

<i>gretchen, you achieved

01:32:36,683 --> 01:32:38,618
fox news(notícias) is the most(a maioria) successful

1986
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:40,103
cable franchise in history.

1987
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:44,290
gretchen carlson's lawyers.

1988
01:32:45,758 --> 01:32:48,061
she wants(quer) to settle.

1989
01:32:48,094 --> 01:32:50,563
it's a lot less appealing
to sue you personally

1990
01:32:50,596 --> 01:32:52,531
without rupert's money
behind you.

1991
01:32:56,569 --> 01:32:57,571
hey, ken.

1992
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:01,975
ken.

1993
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:29,512
hey! look(olhar) who's here.

1994
01:33:29,536 --> 01:33:30,969
oh, my gosh!

1995
01:33:31,003 --> 01:33:33,373
- i brought you some(alguns) small people.
- yard! yatesy!

1996
01:33:33,406 --> 01:33:34,917
oh, my gosh.
i've missed you guys(pessoal) so much.

1997
01:33:34,941 --> 01:33:36,776
we practiced that(este) scare
for two weeks.

1998
01:33:36,809 --> 01:33:37,977
look at you.

1999
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:39,612
- hi.
- hi.

2000
01:33:39,645 --> 01:33:41,224
i love(amar) you, mama.

2001
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,848
my little chubble-wubbles.

2002
01:33:42,882 --> 01:33:43,860
we got her.

2003
01:33:43,884 --> 01:33:44,884
all right.

2004
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:46,785
she was so scared.

2005
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,120
thank you.

2006
01:33:48,154 --> 01:33:50,123
how are you, sweetheart?

2007
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:52,025
i'm either damned for doing(fazendo) it

2008
01:33:52,058 --> 01:33:53,460
or damned
for not doing(fazendo) it sooner.

2009
01:33:55,695 --> 01:33:57,998
tell me my big mouth
didn't ruin our life.

2010
01:33:58,798 --> 01:33:59,800
not yet.

2011
01:34:06,572 --> 01:34:08,742
can i speak
to roger alone, please?

2012
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:18,937
are you sure
you want(querer) beth here?

2013
01:34:19,786 --> 01:34:21,355
well, of course.

2014
01:34:27,794 --> 01:34:30,130
gretchen taped
your conversations.

2015
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:33,466
that's a goddamn(maldito) lie.

2016
01:34:33,499 --> 01:34:34,801
for over(sobre) a year.

2017
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:39,072
but...

2018
01:34:39,972 --> 01:34:41,674
you don't believe her?

2019
01:34:41,707 --> 01:34:44,677
your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from(a partir de) tapes.

2020
01:34:48,748 --> 01:34:50,482
why didn't they(elas) tell(dizer) us before?

2021
01:34:50,516 --> 01:34:52,552
so you'd issue complete denials.

2022
01:34:54,687 --> 01:34:56,423
so you'd have(ter) no credibility.

2023
01:35:03,062 --> 01:35:04,998
apparently,
she did her homework.

2024
01:35:22,048 --> 01:35:24,984
<i>god bless our
next president, donald trump,</i>

2025
01:35:25,017 --> 01:35:29,189
<i>and god bless
the united states of america!</i>

2026
01:35:30,156 --> 01:35:31,825
<i>usa!</i>

2027
01:35:32,792 --> 01:35:34,893
mr. giuliani's fired(disparamos) up.

2028
01:35:34,927 --> 01:35:36,930
when we come(venha) back,
we'll discuss his speech

2029
01:35:36,963 --> 01:35:38,932
with the man
who helped write it.

2030
01:35:38,965 --> 01:35:40,467
clear.

2031
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,101
<i>don't react, okay?</i>

2032
01:35:42,134 --> 01:35:43,169
mmm-hmm.

2033
01:35:43,202 --> 01:35:44,538
<i>roger's out.</i>

2034
01:35:47,974 --> 01:35:49,242
is that(este) sourced, gil?

2035
01:35:49,275 --> 01:35:51,244
<i>yeah. the</i> new york post.

2036
01:35:51,277 --> 01:35:53,112
<i>they put him on the cover.</i>

2037
01:35:53,145 --> 01:35:54,848
<i>rupert's telling him to let go.</i>

2038
01:35:55,882 --> 01:35:56,982
then it's a scoop.

2039
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,018
<i>we're gonna(vai) win.
we're gonna(vai) win so big.</i>

2040
01:35:59,051 --> 01:36:00,887
<i>thank you very(muito) much, everybody.</i>

2041
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,231
there is some
breaking news(notícias) tonight

2042
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:03,957
in the worlds of
media and politics.

2043
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,758
a blockbuster shakeup
at fox news.

2044
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:07,193
a dramatic fall from(a partir de) grace.

2045
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:10,196
roger ailes is out as top boss.

2046
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:11,931
they want(querer) us
to circle the block.

2047
01:36:11,964 --> 01:36:13,166
no. hold on.

2048
01:36:16,669 --> 01:36:18,538
- what's going(vai) on?
- go around.

2049
01:36:21,607 --> 01:36:23,527
i've been(estive) shut out.

2050
01:36:31,651 --> 01:36:32,485
<i>it's true.</i>

2051
01:36:32,519 --> 01:36:34,954
everything gretchen said,
it's all true.

2052
01:36:34,987 --> 01:36:36,089
roger lied to me.

2053
01:36:36,122 --> 01:36:38,624
why?
because i'm a manager here,

2054
01:36:38,658 --> 01:36:40,793
so i have(ter) concerns
my public defense of roger

2055
01:36:40,826 --> 01:36:42,595
could be construed as coercive.

2056
01:36:42,628 --> 01:36:44,698
hey. huh. pants.

2057
01:36:45,165 --> 01:36:46,233
fuck off, neil.

2058
01:36:59,912 --> 01:37:01,247
sorry to keep(guarda) you waiting.

2059
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,916
no, no, no, no, no, sit down.

2060
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:05,185
appreciate you
driving up here, roger.

2061
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:07,954
- susan estrich.
- susan.

2062
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:13,326
i hate that(este) it's come(venha) to this.

2063
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:14,861
me, too.

2064
01:37:25,271 --> 01:37:29,208
we gave(deu) these(esses) women(mulheres) jobs.

2065
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:32,178
put them(eles) on the air,
made them(eles) famous.

2066
01:37:32,211 --> 01:37:34,080
do you think
for a goddamn(maldito) second

2067
01:37:34,113 --> 01:37:36,549
i did any damage to any of them?

2068
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:39,085
no, you don't.

2069
01:37:41,754 --> 01:37:42,956
you don't, rupert.

2070
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:47,861
there's no audience
for that(este) side of the story.

2071
01:37:58,371 --> 01:37:59,506
to begin with,

2072
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:02,308
half this, you already owe him
from last year's bonus.

2073
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,177
and we're paying it.

2074
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:05,912
and paying off your(seu) contract.

2075
01:38:05,945 --> 01:38:07,180
consider yourself(você mesma) lucky.

2076
01:38:07,213 --> 01:38:10,617
it's a contractual obligation.

2077
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:14,787
i created the murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

2078
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:17,190
a third of your(seu) margin.

2079
01:38:17,223 --> 01:38:19,325
there are three of you.

2080
01:38:19,358 --> 01:38:21,194
i guess that(este) means
i pay for the food

2081
01:38:21,227 --> 01:38:23,029
that one of you puts
in your(seu) mouth.

2082
01:38:24,664 --> 01:38:25,865
what if it's you?

2083
01:38:25,898 --> 01:38:27,634
i'd have(ter) fired(disparamos) you for cause.

2084
01:38:27,667 --> 01:38:29,002
roger,

2085
01:38:29,035 --> 01:38:31,671
you built an amazing business.

2086
01:38:31,704 --> 01:38:33,607
no one can take(levar) that
away from(a partir de) you.

2087
01:38:34,674 --> 01:38:37,377
but under the circumstances,

2088
01:38:38,678 --> 01:38:41,214
this is a lot of money.

2089
01:38:41,247 --> 01:38:42,882
and it won't look(olhar) good
to the people

2090
01:38:42,915 --> 01:38:44,350
that don't know(conhecer) your(seu) worth.

2091
01:38:44,383 --> 01:38:46,052
take it.

2092
01:38:46,085 --> 01:38:47,954
honor your(seu) non-compete.

2093
01:38:55,361 --> 01:38:57,163
i never(nunca) cared about(cerca de) the money.

2094
01:38:58,297 --> 01:38:59,766
we know, roger.

2095
01:39:06,972 --> 01:39:08,008
okay.

2096
01:39:09,842 --> 01:39:12,712
okay.

2097
01:39:12,745 --> 01:39:15,214
i'd like(como) to go
to the newsroom with(com) you.

2098
01:39:15,247 --> 01:39:18,084
i'd like(como) us to announce
my leaving together.

2099
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:25,091
no.

2100
01:39:37,136 --> 01:39:39,705
the end of the leg man.

2101
01:39:41,307 --> 01:39:43,043
i won't miss(perder) him.

2102
01:39:43,943 --> 01:39:44,978
boys.

2103
01:39:54,019 --> 01:39:56,022
hope you two know
what you're doing.

2104
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:04,130
once roger's office is cleared
of handguns, i'll move in.

2105
01:40:04,163 --> 01:40:06,799
i'll run the network
till the ship's aright.

2107
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:14,307

2108
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:16,242

what's going(vai) on at fox?

2113
01:40:28,154 --> 01:40:29,022
would you say
people are shocked?

2114
01:40:29,055 --> 01:40:30,823
can rupert
afford to dump roger?

2115

megyn. come(venha) on!
