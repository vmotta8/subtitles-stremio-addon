I heard they shut you down, sir...

from the stratosphere onto starving people.

350
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,521
When they realized
that killing other people was...

351
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,524
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

- In secret.
- Why secret?

353
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,788

wouldn't allow spending on space exploration.

I was alive. You were going anyway.

But something sent you here.

- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,347

Who's "they"?

400
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,581
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

401
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,377
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

402
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,705
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

403
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,774
Yeah, over the Straights.

Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

405
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,796
Exactly.

406
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:52,519
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

407
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,688
Out near Saturn...

408
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,973
a disturbance of space-time.

409
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,229
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

410
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,775
- And it leads where?
- Another galaxy.

411
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,746
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

412
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,364
Someone placed it there.

413
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,658
- "They"?
- Mm.

414
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,246
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

415
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:24,343
That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
It came along right as we needed it.

416
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,429
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

417
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,514
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

418
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,059
- You sent probes into that?
- Mm-hm.

419
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,562
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,398

00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,310

twelve Ranger launches carrying...

00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:48,183

423
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:51,453
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

424
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,580
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

425
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,958
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

426
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,996
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

427
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,717
then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

428
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,961
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

429
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,005
Hence the bravery.

430
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,308
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

431
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,834
No.

432
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,271
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

433
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:23,485
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

434
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,478
And one system shows promise.

435
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,656
One. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

436
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,027
One system with three potential worlds?

437
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,329
No long shot.

438
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,324
Okay.

439
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,568
So if we find a home...

440
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,499
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

441
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,045
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

442
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,506
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

443
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,146
COOPER:
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

444
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,982
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

445
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:15,287
- BRAND: Both. Plan A.
- How do you get it off the ground?

446
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,291
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

447
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,928
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

448
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,833
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

449
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,494
But you haven't solved it yet.

450
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,922
That's why there's Plan B.

451
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,102
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

452
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,595
This is one way.

453
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,431
Plan B: A population bomb.

454
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,520
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

455
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,697
How would you raise them?

456
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,325
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

457
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,404
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

458
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,374
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

459
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,953
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

460
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,088
This takes care of that.

461
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,749
But what about the people here?
You just...

462
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,536
You give up on them? My kids?

463
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,215
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

- Almost there.

is what I feel like I was born to do?

478
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,700
And it excites me? Heh.

479
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,837
No, that does not make it wrong.

480
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:33,666
It might. Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

that's the foundation.

And the foundation's solid.

We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,723
"Next year."

485
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,061
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

it was never meant to die here.

to make things right with Murph.

489
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,582
I will.

490
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,211
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

491
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,849
You have to talk to me, Murph.

492
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,445
I need to fix this before I go.

493
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,523
MURPH: Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

494
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,113
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

495
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,515
She said, "Now...

496
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,496
we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

497
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,129
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

498
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,636
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

499
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,432
You said ghosts didn't exist.

500
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,398
That's right, Murph.

501
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,344
Murph, look at me.

502
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,491
I can't be your ghost right now.

503
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,487
I need to exist.

504
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,832
They chose me.

505
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,503
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

506
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,634
That's exactly why you can't go.

507
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,805
I figured out the message.

508
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,401
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

509
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,936
"Stay."

510
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,189
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

511
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,575
You don't believe me.

512
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,536
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

513
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,697
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

514
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,668
- No, I'm coming back.
- When?

515
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,017
One for you, one for me.

516
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,387
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

517
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,964
traveling near the speed of light, or...

518
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,651
near a black hole...

519
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,598
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

520
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,276
When we get back...

521
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,287
we're gonna compare.

522
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,315
- MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

523
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,870
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

524
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,481
"What?" Imagine that!

525
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,262
Aw, Murph...

526
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,390
You have no idea when you're coming back.

527
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,929
No idea at all!

528
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,607
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.

529
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,308
Come on, Murph!

530
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,445
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

531
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,778
Hey...

532
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,208
I love you. Forever. You hear me?

533
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,819
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

534
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,952
I'm coming back.

535
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,447
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

536
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,357
Just fine.

537
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,948
I love you, Tom.

538
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,585
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

539
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,004
You look after our place
for me, all right?

540
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,830
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

541
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:31,113
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

542
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,041
I'll make sure they bring it back.

543
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,962
Look after my kids, Donald!

544
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,861
TARS:
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

545
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:56,581
- Dad!
- ...nine...

546
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,032
Dad!

547
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:00,402
...eight...

548
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:03,738
- seven...
- Dad!

549
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:05,314
...six...

550
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,210
five, main engine start, four...

551
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:11,912
three...

552
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,706
two...

553
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:16,709
one. Booster ignition and...

554
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,437
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

555
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,570
Prepare for stage one separation.

556
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,946
Stage one.

557
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,745
There is Mach 1.

558
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,417
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

559
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,589
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

560
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,557
He thinks it relaxes us.

561
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,552
A giant sarcastic robot.

562
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,813
What a great idea!

563
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,691
TARS: I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

564
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,900
That'd probably help.

565
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,021
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

566
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,075
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

567
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,068
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

568
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,237
TARS: Stage two separation.

569
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,175
COOPER: All feeds going manual.

570
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,193
MAN: Going manual.

571
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,223
COOPER: Deactivate probe heater one,
two and three.

572
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,466
MAN: Check.

573
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,974
- Taking control.
- TARS: This is handover to you.

574
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,105
- MAN: A.D.F. check.
- COOPER: Over.

575
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,076
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

576
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,613
- MAN: One hundred percent.
- COOPER: Ex-mites.

577
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,293
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids. Your father.

578
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,263
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

579
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,508
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

580
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,312
Just being honest.

581
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,847
I don't think you need to be that honest.

582
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,650
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

583
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,445
- TARS: Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

584
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,243
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic,

585
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:38,409
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

586
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,069
Okay.

587
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,155
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

588
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,079
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

589
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,181
Okay. Taking control.

590
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,521
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

591
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,660
It's all you, Doyle.

592
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,681
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

593
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,406
- I feel good.
- Take us home.

594
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,274
[BEEPING]

595
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,441
- Lock.
- Target locked.

596
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,543
- COOPER: Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

597
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,786
Good job.

598
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,656
Door's not charging. Never mind.

599
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,139
Cooper, you should have control.

600
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,974
Control here.

601
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,019
Communication with ring module active.

602
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,027
WOMAN: Oh, wow.

603
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,993
TARS: That's initiate.

604
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,044
- COOPER: Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

605
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,808
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

606
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,686
All right, we're all set.

607
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,646
All right, let's do it.

608
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,458
Heh.

609
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,093
COOPER: Thirty percent of spin.

610
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,352
One G.

611
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,104
How's gravity treating you back there?

612
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,006
Well.

613
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,536
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

614
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,746
- Yeah.
- You all right?

615
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,031
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

616
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,640
I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

617
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,600
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

618
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,455
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

619
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,316
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

620
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,969
Amelia, be safe.

621
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,773
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

622
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:24,395
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

623
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,647
That's a lot of Dramamine.

624
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,817
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

625
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,353
We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

626
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:37,491
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

627
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,664
BRAND:
Do not go gentle into that good night

628
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:48,377
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day

629
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:54,508
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

630
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:59,179
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

631
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,391
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

632
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,353
Do not go gentle into that good night

633
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,558
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

634
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,627
- DOYLE: You good?
- ROMILLY: Yeah.

635
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,046
Okay, thank you, sir.

636
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,084
Here. Pills.

637
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,255
So alone.

638
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,482
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

639
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,025
No, I mean them.

640
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,318
Hm?

641
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,813
COOPER: It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

642
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,651
No, it's not like looking
for a new condo.

643
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,945
The human race is going to be...

644
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:58,456
adrift...

645
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,159
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

646
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,578
We need to find that rock.

647
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:09,667
And our three prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

648
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,595
Laura Miller's planet is first.

649
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,922
- Laura started our biology program.
- COOPER: Mm-hm.

650
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,097
- AMELIA: Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

651
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,884
Oh, uh... Wolf's a particle physicist.

652
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,313
None of them had families, huh?

653
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,201
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

654
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,913
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

655
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,040
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

656
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,125
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

657
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,211
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

658
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,757
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

659
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,509
Scientists, explorers.

660
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,796
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

661
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,915
Death, but...

662
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,801
not evil.

663
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,845
You don't think nature can be evil?

664
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,089
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

665
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,684
- ...no, not evil.
- Hm.

666
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,147
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

667
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,949
Just what we take with us, then.

668
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,434
Yeah.

669
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,703
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

670
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,038
Even me, huh?

671
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,207
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

672
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,708
There you go.

673
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,253
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

674
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:31,498
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

675
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,341
Hey, TARS? Let's go over
that trajectory one more time.

676
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,343
TARS: Eight months to Mars.

677
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,647
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

678
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,232
