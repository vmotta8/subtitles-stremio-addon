MEGYN: (ON TV) Welcome
to The Kelly File, everyone.

2
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,104
I'm Megyn Kelly.

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,673
Breaking tonight, polls are
moving, the race is changing,

4
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,475
and more than a dozen
Republican candidates

5
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:43,776
are trying
to make themselves heard

6
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,745
with a little more than
one week left

7
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,848
till the debate
that could change everything.

8
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,249
And we're the gateway.

9
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:51,617
We, the questioners,
are the gateway.

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,852
We at Fox and CNN

11
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,420
and everybody else
who gets a chance

12
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,388
to actually moderate

13
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,722
a presidential debate
with these guys.

14
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:57,690
I mean, these guys,

15
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,759
they deserve to face
tough questioning.

16
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,594
As Chris says, and I agree,

17
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,162
they want
George Washington's job

18
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:04,330
and they better earn it.

19
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:05,631
They better show
the American people

20
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:06,732
they're worthy of it.

21
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:08,267
A lot of folks assumed

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,636
Donald Trump
would flame out by now.

23
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:13,306
They have been proven wrong.
Now wait.

24
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,407
Here. We gotta get to this

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,143
because this is just breaking
on The Daily Beast.

26
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:18,277
The headline is,

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,615
"Ex-wife: Donald Trump made me
feel violated during sex.

28
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,117
Ivana Trump once accused

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,619
the real-estate tycoon
of quote, 'rape.'"

30
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:28,287
Somebody who speaks
for Donald Trump

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,256
has come out
and denied it as well

32
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,425
and added that legally,
he says,

33
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,461
"you cannot rape your spouse."

34
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:38,197
Here's the one thing
you probably know about me.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,832

36

38
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,638
Megyn.

39
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,638
MEGYN: Morning, Roger.

40
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,740
What'd you do
to piss off Trump?

41
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,475
MEGYN: We did a segment
on recent coverage

42
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,177
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

43
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,411
You're giving that oxygen

44
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:53,813
before the first
goddamn debate?

45
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:57,517
Roger, we had a full-screen
of Ivana's recantation.

46
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,551
Which is soft.

47
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,520
ROGER: She accused him
during a divorce.

48
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,189
Well, his lawyer,
Michael Cohen,

49
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,557
claims you can't
rape a spouse.

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,825
It pissed me off.

51
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,661
Great. The future of Fox News
is now a goddamn feminist.

52
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,163
No. I'm not a feminist.

53
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,664
I'm a lawyer.

54
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,664
We need him.

55
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,500
Clean this up. Now.

56
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,737
MEGYN: Unfortunately,
when it comes to

57
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,438
politicians and the media,

58
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,407
Roger Ailes knows his shit.

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,342
Appointed head of
the Fox News channel

60
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,911
by media mogul Rupert Murdoch,

61
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:29,182
Roger transformed cable news,
pushing Fox to the forefront.

62
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,217
Years before,
to get Nixon elected,

63
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,719
he created the modern
town-hall debate.

64
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,254
To get Reagan elected,

65
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,822
he made him address
the elephant in the room.

66
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:40,560
I will not make age
an issue of this campaign.

67
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,461
I am not going to exploit

68
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,697
my opponent's youth
and inexperience.

69

(ALL LAUGH)

70
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,867
MEGYN: To get
George H.W. Bush elected,

71
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,535
somebody did
the Willie Horton ads.

72
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,772
Roger denies it was him...
a lot.

73
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,508
I have been astounded
at the number of Americans

74
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,543
who are fine with our country

75
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,345
moving
in a socialist direction.

76
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:00,313
ROGER: Here we go.

77
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,516
Their views on capitalism
are quite alarming.

78
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,818
I'm a...

79
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,818

80
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,386
You take your hands
off the wheel

81
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,522
and it pulls hard to the left.

82
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,793
Hey, look at this.
James Murdoch.

83
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,295

85
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,204
This is what
nepotism gets you.

86
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,440
Roger rules Fox
from behind these doors,

87
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,908
on the second floor.

88
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,544
When employees say,
"the second floor,"

89
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:32,945
they mean Roger,

90
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,648
or the many VPs
paid to enact his will

91
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,917

92
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,786
Now, I know what some of you
are thinking, and no,

93
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,822

what to say on air.

He doesn't have to.

95

96
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,725

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

219
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:22,735
Mr. Trump, one of the things
people love about you

220
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,736
is you speak your mind

221
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,938
and you don't use
a politician's filter.

222
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,707
However, that is not
without its downsides.

223
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,209
In particular,
when it comes to women.

224
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:35,080
You've called women you don't
like, "fat pigs," "dogs,"

"slobs"
and "disgusting animals."

You once told a contestant
on Celebrity Apprentice

it would be a pretty picture
to see her on her knees.

Does that sound to you
like the temperament

of a man we should elect
as President?

241

he'd respect the challenge.

00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,421
We're running over,
we're running over.

359
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,991
Yeah, well, HR is on the phone
'cause you called me a skirt.

360
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,392
CO-HOST: I gotta read
that manual again.

361
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,895
GRETCHEN:
I'll bring it to your office
right after the show.

362
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,896
GUEST 1: Some guy came up
to me and said,

363
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,030
"I saw you on Fox & Friends
this morning.

364
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,800
"Is Gretchen as cute in person
as she is on TV?"

365
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,401
Oh, come on.

366
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,401
And what did you answer him?

367
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,469
Beautiful dress.

368
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,037
You look wonderful.
Great color.

369
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,405
In summary,
Gretchen's beautiful.

370
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,840
Beautiful. You look beautiful.

371
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,809
Well, you look fabulous, too.

372
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,944
CO-HOST: 'Cause you gotta wax?
Does the waxing hurt?

373
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,813
Uh, he looks at me for that!

374
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,347
CO-HOST: We'll try that.
Women are everywhere.

375
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,082
We're letting 'em play golf
and tennis now.

376
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,216
It's outta control.

377
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,216
You know what?

378
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,351
CO-HOST: You know...
(CHUCKLES) She's out.

379
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:10,189
You read the headlines,
since men are so great.

380
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,257
She needed a shower.

(CLICKS TV OFF)

382
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,993
The attitude off-camera
was even worse.

383
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,929
Steve simply started
ignoring me.

384
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,464
What did Mr. Ailes say
when you complained?

385
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,067
He said, "You act
like it only rains on women.

386
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,138
"Stop getting goddamn offended
by everything.

387
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,406
"You're a man-hater."

388
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,543
And, um, "Learn to get along
with the boys."

389
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,911
Then he took me off the show.

390
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,279
But gave you your own.

391
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,481
Well, in the afternoon
dead zone.

392
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,350
I mean, it was a demotion
and we both knew it.

393
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:42,421
Even though I did increase
the ratings by 15%.

to second base.

before I graduated
summa cum laude from Stanford,

397
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,997
before I was crowned
Miss America,

398
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,398
I played second base

399
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,467
in the sixth-grade
softball league.

400
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,638
I hate second base.

401
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,607
Did he ever offer
to reverse that decision

402
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,877
if you made yourself
sexually available?

403
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,478
Not directly.

404
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,348
(CLICKS TONGUE) With Roger,
it's always about loyalty.

405
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,884
He says he can fix things
if you're loyal.

406
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,286
And you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

407
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,422
We don't guess.

408
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,358
(SIGHS) Oral sex.

409
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,792
Roger likes to joke,

410
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,395
"To get ahead,
you gotta give a little head."

411
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,430
Really.

412
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,498
But Mr. Ailes

413
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:29,501
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex?

414
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,404
I mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

415
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,573
Like, "You're sexy
but you're too much work."

416
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:35,908
You're... I mean...

417

I have a whole list in here

because that's just
how Roger is.

00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,681
What do you want
out of a lawsuit?

420
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:46,652
What do I want?
I want this behavior to stop.

421
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,454
Someone has to speak up.
Someone has to get mad.

422
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,556
Well, that may not be you.

423
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,492
Your contract
will have a clause

with Rudi Bakhtiar's case?

00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,164
Well, you're supposed to be.

Well, Rudi, come on,
that's a given.

But, um...

how I feel about you, right?

is to see the inside
of your hotel room.

Don't react.
Make it your fault.

to make you think
I feel that way about you,

453
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,128
I apologize.

454
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,196

00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,464
We're friends.

a great professional vibe.

I've never had to do that
for a job.

I know, I know.

462
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,242
You know I'd kill for DC,

463
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,345
but there's no way
I'm showing you my hotel room.

464
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,348
This is gonna
ruin my career.

00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,652
Well, now I feel
like a creep.

No. (CHUCKLES)
No, you're so not.

apparently. Assholes.

NANCY: She proved
what they wanted her to prove.

471
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:50,242
No one really wins
by suing Fox News.

472
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,310
NEIL: It's been our experience

473
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,646
that once you go public
in your job,

474
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,417
no one will hire you.

475
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,485
If you're able
to stick it out at Fox,

476
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:01,586
gather more evidence,

477
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:06,558
you might be able to sue
Ailes himself instead of Fox.

478
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,726
And that is why I'm here.

479
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,763
Because Marty Hyman told me
that over here in New Jersey,

480
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:15,367
I can avoid arbitration
by suing Roger personally.

481
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,569
He says that you've managed
to change the law,

482
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,237
and that we could
call other women

483
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,705
and show a pattern.

484
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,574
Will other women come forward?

485
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:23,842
GRETCHEN: Yes, they will.

486
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,244
You live and work in New York.

487
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:28,213
Roger has a house
in Bergen County

488
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:30,082
where he stays
when he can't make it upstate.

489
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,551
(CHUCKLES) You do
your homework, Ms. Carlson.

490
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,220
No fingerprints.

491
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,489
That's how much I practiced
the violin as a child.

492
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,357
If Roger finds out
you came to us,

493
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,460
he won't just fire you.

494
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,460
GRETCHEN: Mmm.

495
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,696
He will bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

496
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,299
He will attack you personally.

497
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,234
These men, they care
more about their reputations

498
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,402
than they do money.

499
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,636
Roger won't stop.

500
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,238
Oh, I know. Mmm-hmm.

501
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,238
NANCY: You know that.

502
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,841
Colleagues you admire
will say publicly

503
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,876
you're a superior,
ambitious woman

504
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:00,279
who's suing
because her career stalled.

505
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,347
Let 'em.

506
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:06,885

with everything he's got.

00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,196

I'm telling you,

KAYLA: Frankly,
I think you have a gap

516
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,474
in the network, Mr. Shine.

517
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,811
There are millions of young
conservatives in this country.

518
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,714
I mean, you can look at my
Instagram account. There are.

519
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,816
They don't have a voice
on our network.

520
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,887
I see myself as an influencer
in the Jesus space.

521
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,321
And don't get me wrong,

522
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,457
I've learned a ton
from Gretchen,

523
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,591
I truly have, of course.

524
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:49,261
But no judgment here,

525
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,164
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

526
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,267
It's just not that helpful
to her.

527
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,270
I mean, to be honest,
Mr. Shine,

528
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,639
she's sort of Establishment.

529
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,374
With a capital E.

530
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,910

The more she sells out,

711
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:53,191
the wider
her nostrils have become.

712
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,026
Listen to
what I've just said to you.

713
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:55,927
He's here.

714
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,129
SAVAGE:
This woman was once pretty,

715
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,731
and the more she has sold out,

716
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,099
the wider
her nostrils have become.

717
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,667
They're almost porcine.

718
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,669
She snorts her insults
at America...

719
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:05,937
Roger!

720
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,772
...and, as I say, it's now
the portrait of Dorian Kelly,

721
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,207
not the portrait
of Dorian Gray.

722
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,677
Give me a day to figure out
how we hit Trump back.

723
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,811
Stop by later. (GRUNTS)

724
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:15,647
I don't want my kids
hearing this crap.

725
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,249
Ignore the damn morons.

726
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,751
I'm old, fat, and ugly.

727
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,153
Christ,
they call me Jabba the Hutt.

728
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:26,624
Hemophilia swells my joints.
Can't exercise.

729
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,927
I feel fine,
but I look like shit.

730
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,229
I look the opposite
of how I feel.

731
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:34,533
Do I let it affect me?
No, I do not.

732
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,735
MEGYN:
This isn't entirely true.

733
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,170
Roger is also fat

734
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,838
because he'll get
a room-service menu

735
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:41,940
and order page two.

736
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,008
No goddamn orange on Fox!

737
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,843
But he cares a lot
about looks.

738
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:47,145
Fucking idiots.

739
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,080
Let's turn our attention
to South Korea.

740
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,248
South Korean officials say

741
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:53,017
talks with the north have
adjourned until tomorrow...

742
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,319
MEGYN: Early on, he realized

743
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,354
for a network to stay on
24 hours a day,

744
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,957
you need something
to hold an audience.

745
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,158
Joining me to discuss

746
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,960
the Korean peninsula
is Seth Choy...

747
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,862
MEGYN: That something is legs.

748
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:06,765
There's a reason
for clear desks.

749
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:10,702
We need you
in a shorter dress.

750
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,836
KIMBERLY: But you know
that they're gonna take...

751
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,872
ROGER: Wide shot! Wider!

752
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,673
Go to the wide shot!

753
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,375
I want to see
her goddamn legs.

754
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,310
Why the fuck
do you think I hired her?

755
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:20,712
KIMBERLY: But this might
be seen by racial activists

756
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,047
purely
through the racial prism.

757
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,385
Uh, stand up
and give me a spin.

758
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,821
Really?

759
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,821
Yeah, it's a visual medium.

760
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,962
Yeah.
That's good. Sit down.

761
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:39,831
I support the wall. I do.

762
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,000
But mass deportations,
come on.

763
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,101
That'll never work

764
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,336
because of the 14th Amendment.
You want me to quote it?

765
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,871
"If you were born in America,

766
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:48,873
"you're an American, period.
Period."

767
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:50,842
Get me
a demographically friendly

768
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,777
Hispanic woman on immigration.

769
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,180
But, hey, she needs to be
very demographically friendly.

770
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,750
Okay. Uh, new girl's up.
Kayla.

771
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,285
Hi, sir.

772
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,354
So, I was listening to
Rush Limbaugh this morning.

773
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:06,224
He said something kind of cool
about Anthony Weiner.

774
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,260
How he's an exhibitionist
in every aspect

775
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,963
of how he presents himself
politically.

776
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,031
(WHISPERS) Oh, my God.

777
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,932
O'REILLY: Is she the best
you can do?

778
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:18,069
PRODUCER: Bill Shine asked us
to give her a try, so...

779
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,272
O'REILLY: Okay, let's not lose
focus. Back to immigration.

780
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,441
Oh, my gosh.

781
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,842
I can't get fired.

782
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,812
This is the only job
I have ever wanted.

783
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:31,049
I don't wanna be on TV,
I wanna be on Fox.

784
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,918
JESS: Uh-huh.

785
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,918
My family, every day,

786
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,354
every holiday,
especially holidays,

787
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:37,822
they watch Fox News.

788
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,691
We're like addicts.

789
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,025
Fox is how we do church.

790
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,326
You know when they made
the corner logo turn...

791
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,460
The bug.

792
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,064
...because folks had "Fox"
burned into their TV screens?

793
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,198
That's us.

794
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,800
Kayla,
you're not getting fired.

795
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,268
He cannot scale his anger.

796
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,936
He's a perpetual
outrage machine.

797
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,172
That's why crazies love him.
No offense to your family.

798
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,474
You want to do the folders?
No crying at Fox.

799
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,709
No crying.

800
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,947
Let me explain
your mistake here.

801
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,949
So, Rush is on Hannity's team.

802
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,118
They're the competition.
They're GOP party hacks.

803
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:08,720
So, he thinks
he's way ahead of them,

804
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,955
so steal from Drudge
and Breitbart, not talk radio.

805
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:11,923
Okay.

806
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,825
Also, stop worrying
if the story's legit.

807
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,892
If you can't source it,

808
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,828
just go with,
"Some are saying."

809
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,929
Seriously?

810
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:20,765
You have to adopt

811
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,400
the mentality of
an Irish street cop.

812
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,436
The world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

813
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,871
minorities are criminals,

814
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,740
sex is sick,
but interesting.

815
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,142
Ask yourself, "What would
scare my grandmother,

816
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,077
"or piss off my grandfather?"

817
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,747
And that's a Fox story.
Are you writing this down?

818
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,948
Oh, it makes
so much sense.

819
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,316
JESS: Frighten, titillate.

820
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,316
Right.

821
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,519
JESS: Frighten, titillate.
Frighten, titillate.

822
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:42,920
When you're starting
the story,

823
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:44,222
you need to start
with a clear villain.

824
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,890

00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,294
Uh-huh.

829
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:51,996
Conservatives
want to conserve.

830
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,165
Uh-huh.

831
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,165
You're the last defense

832
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,302
against Jesus-hating,
trans-loving,

Oh, come on.

00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:06,811
You do believe
some of that, right?

836
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,413
Yeah.

837
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,915

00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:22,127
Thank you.

I guess I do.

849

Okay, my parents
would be horrified

850
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,281
if I went home
with a Democrat.

851
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,418
The lesbianism, however?

852
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,053
Oh, I'm not a lesbian.

853
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,156
I'm not a Democrat.

At Fox News?

Oh, my God.
I thought that you knew that.

00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,443
No, I didn't know that.

wanna be gay at Fox.

Except from Megyn Kelly.

1755

She's been unusually silent.

1756
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,548
Right. Well,
something must've happened

1757
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,483
to Megyn in the past
with Roger.

1758
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,053
She's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1759
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,421
MARTIN: Possibly.

1760
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:34,790
Should you call?

1761
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,826
Tell her this is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1762

Megyn, share?

1763
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:41,797
No. She wouldn't do it.

1764
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,598
What makes you say that?

1765
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,598
Because I wouldn't.

1766
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:46,668
I mean, Roger plays his women
off against each other.

1767
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:47,969
He's always done it.
He'll say,

1768
01:11:48,002 --> 01:11:49,938
"Megyn thinks that
Lisa should get your spot."

1769
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:52,441
Or, "Megyn suspects
that you're screwing Cal."

1770
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,076
And then he'll offer advice
on how to get back at her,

1771
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,310
as if you brought it up.

1772
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,913

She's renegotiating her deal.
I can think of roughly

1773
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,615
15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

1774
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:02,684
We do need some collaboration.

1775

that would certainly help

1776
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:05,587
