00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:36,803
megyn: (on tv) welcome
to the kelly file, everyone.

2
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,104
i'm megyn kelly.

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,673
breaking tonight, polls are
moving, the race is changing,

4
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,475
and more(mais) than(do que) a dozen
republican candidates

5
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:43,776
are trying
to make(fazer) themselves heard

6
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,745
with a little(pequena) more(mais) than
one week left

7
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,848
till the debate
that could(poderia) change(mudança) everything.

8
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,249
and we're the gateway.

9
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:51,617
we, the questioners,
are the gateway.

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,852
we at fox and cnn

11
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,420
and everybody(todo o mundo) else
who gets(fica) a chance

12
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,388
to actually moderate

13
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,722
a presidential debate
with these(esses) guys.

14
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:57,690
i mean, these(esses) guys,

15
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,759
they deserve to face
tough questioning.

16
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,594
as chris says, and i agree,

17
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,162
they want
george washington's job

18
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:04,330
and they(elas) better(melhor) earn it.

19
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:05,631
they better(melhor) show
the american people

20
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:06,732
they're worthy of it.

21
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:08,267
a lot of folks assumed

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,636
donald trump
would flame out by now.

23
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:13,306
they have(ter) been(estive) proven wrong.
now wait.

24
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,407
here. we gotta(preciso) get to this

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,143
because this(isto) is just(somente) breaking
on the daily beast.

26
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:18,277
the headline is,

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,615
"ex-wife: donald trump(trunfo) made(fez) me
feel violated during(durante) sex.

28
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,117
ivana trump(trunfo) once(uma vez) accused

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,619
the real-estate tycoon
of quote, 'rape.'"

30
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:28,287
somebody who speaks
for donald trump

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,256
has come(venha) out
and denied it as well

32
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,425
and added that(este) legally,
he says,

33
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,461
"you cannot rape your(seu) spouse."

34
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:38,197
here's the one thing
you probably know(conhecer) about(cerca de) me.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,832
i have(ter) a big mouth.

36
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,568
faye: (on phone) roger,
you have(ter) megyn on line(linha) one.

37
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:43,736
(grunts)

38
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,638
megyn.

39
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,638
megyn: morning, roger.

40
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,740
what'd you do
to piss off trump?

41
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,475
megyn: we did a segment
on recent coverage

42
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,177
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

43
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,411
you're giving that(este) oxygen

44
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:53,813
before the first
goddamn debate?

45
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:57,517
roger, we had a full-screen
of ivana's recantation.

46
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,551
which is soft.

47
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,520
roger: she accused him
during a divorce.

48
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,189
well, his lawyer,
michael cohen,

49
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,557
claims you can't
rape a spouse.

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,825
it pissed me off.

51
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,661
great. the future of fox news
is now a goddamn(maldito) feminist.

52
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,163
no. i'm not a feminist.

53
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,664
i'm a lawyer.

54
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,664
we need(necessidade) him.

55
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,500
clean this(isto) up. now.

56
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,737
megyn: unfortunately,
when it comes to

57
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,438
politicians and the media,

58
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,407
roger ailes knows(sabe) his shit.

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,342
appointed head of
the fox news(notícias) channel

60
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,911
by media mogul rupert murdoch,

61
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:29,182
roger transformed cable news,
pushing fox to the forefront.

62
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,217
years before,
to get nixon elected,

63
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,719
he created the modern
town-hall debate.

64
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,254
to get reagan elected,

65
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,822
he made(fez) him address
the elephant in the room.

66
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:40,560
i will(vai) not make(fazer) age
an issue of this(isto) campaign.

67
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,461
i am not going(vai) to exploit

68
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,697
my opponent's youth
and inexperience.

69
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,731
(all laugh)

70
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,867
megyn: to get
george h.w. bush elected,

71
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,535
somebody did
the willie horton ads.

72
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,772
roger denies it was him...
a lot.

73
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,508
i have(ter) been(estive) astounded
at the number of americans

74
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,543
who are fine(multar) with(com) our country

75
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,345
moving
in a socialist direction.

76
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:00,313
roger: here(aqui) we go.

77
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,516
their views on capitalism
are quite alarming.

78
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,818
i'm a...

79
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,818
news is like(como) a ship.

80
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,386
you take(levar) your(seu) hands
off the wheel

81
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,522
and it pulls hard to the left.

82
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,793
hey, look(olhar) at this.
james murdoch.

83
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,295
tell me those(essa) lips
haven't sucked cock.

84
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:17,764
(all laugh)

85
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,204
this is what
nepotism gets(fica) you.

86
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,440
roger rules fox
from behind(atrás) these(esses) doors,

87
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,908
on the second(segundo) floor.

88
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,544
when employees say,
"the second(segundo) floor,"

89
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:32,945
they mean(significar) roger,

90
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,648
or the many vps
paid to enact his will

91
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,917
without qualms or questions.

92
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,786
now, i know(conhecer) what(o que) some(alguns) of you
are thinking, and no,

93
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,822
roger does(faz) not tell(dizer) us
what to say on air.

94
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,923
he doesn't have(ter) to.

95
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,725
love that(este) dress, megyn.

96
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,725
thank you.

97
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,993
no, really. i love(amar) it.

98
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,697
he's not horny.
he's just(somente) ambitious.

99
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,633
roger is always(sempre) watching.

100
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,901
the eagles
postponed their(deles) appearance

101
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,903
because co-founder,
glenn frey,

102
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:58,871
is too ill to travel.

103
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,673
in a statement,
the band announced...

104
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,807
roger: morons.

105
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,043
megyn: the phone(telefone) in his office
connects directly

106
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,411
to the control room...

107
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,411
(line ringing)

108
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,613
...which is down
on the first(primeiro) floor.

109
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,915
(phone ringing)

110
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,351
yes, sir?

111
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,351
roger: you fucking(porra) idiots!

112
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,320
that's not glenn frey,
it's don henley!

113
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,621
rebekah: dump the b-roll.

114
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,621
dump it, dump it.

115
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:16,689
rebekah: back(de volta) to anchor.

116
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,758
that's not glenn frey,
that's don fucking(porra) henley!

117
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,893
oh, shoot.

118
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,893
what the fuck, kayla?

119
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,296
i'm sorry.
i don't know(conhecer) secular music.

120
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,463
the eagles?

121
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,765
only the biggest band
of the '70s.

122
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,366
when my mom was a toddler.

123
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,701
they all look(olhar) the same.

124
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,603
they're just(somente) old.

125
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,603
rebekah: oh, my god.

126
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:34,307
down in the basement
is the fox newsroom.

127
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,876
all our shows(mostra) have(ter) crews
who work(trabalhos) in these(esses) pods.

128
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,012
this is my staff.

129
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,514
hey, guys.

130
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,514
(all greeting)

131
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,983
we're below the city,
so it smells like(como) mold.

132
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,685
but there(lá) hasn't been
a rat sighting

133
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,486
in four(quatro) months.

134
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,954
all: four(quatro) months.

135
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,857
the anchors and their
key producers have(ter) base camps.

136
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,327
here, on 17 and 18.

137
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,928
often decorated
with viewer art.

138
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,499
and everyone(todos) in this(isto) building,

139
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:03,369
even roger, answers to eight.

140
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:04,870
the eighth floor(chão) is home

141
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:07,640
to ceo rupert murdoch
and his sons.

142
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,976
this is the power
behind the power.

143
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,612
the actual studios are
scattered around the building.

144
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:16,749
most anchor
and show(mostrar) offices are here.

145
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,918
above are fox business, radio,

146
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,387
new york(iorque) post
and the wall street journal.

147
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,889
most of the american
conservative establishment.

148
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,058
in one building.

149
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:27,793
reporter 1:
the stage is finally set

150
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,929
for tonight's republican
debate in cleveland.

151
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,030
reporter 2:
all the candidates
are looking

152
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:31,931
for a boost tonight,

153
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,133
but only(só) ten of them
have a chance

154
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,435
to appeal to voters
in prime time.

155
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,004
(people speaking(falando) indistinctly)

156
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,081
trump has a real problem
with women. (sighs)

157
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,383
i wanna(quer) ask about(cerca de) it.

158
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,385

159
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,421
yes.

160
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,724

162
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,930
(people speaking(falando) indistinctly)

163
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,867
(megyn clears throat)

164
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,405

165
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,405

00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:21,681
(megyn retches, coughs)

168
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,918
(megyn breathing heavily)

169
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,157
do you think(pensar) that's it?

170
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,157
(retches)

171
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,826

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,826
sorry.

173
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,596
(toilet flushing)

174
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:39,899
it's probably nerves.

175
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,736
no. when(quando) i'm nervous,
i hear(ouvir) my heart.

176
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,704
i can't hear(ouvir) it.

177
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,704
(exhales deeply)

178
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:49,775
that's your(seu) first(primeiro) question?
is this(isto) some(alguns) feminist(feminista) thing?

179
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,177
both: she's not a feminist.

180
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,678
it goes to his electability.

181
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,648
did you run it
past tom lowell?

182
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,516
we can go after(depois de) trump.

183
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:58,784
gil: the second(segundo) floor
said that?

184
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,686
no.

185
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,622
the eighth. the murdochs.

186
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:07,126
rupert called(chamado) roger and said,
about trump, enough(o suficiente) is enough.

187
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,162
look, all trump(trunfo) does
is watch(ver) fox.

188
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,965
roger gave(deu) him air
for his crazy(louco) theories

189
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,467
and idiot grievances.

190
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,970
why? 'cause roger shares
a lot of them.

191
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,839
are you sure
you wanna(quer) take(levar) that(este) on?

192
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,507
yes.

193
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,542
reporter: (on tv) it's the new
look of politics...

194
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:24,977
okay, i don't know
if these(esses) are strong enough,

195
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,545
but they(elas) help(ajuda) me.

196
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,545
uh-huh. nausea?

197
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:29,115
yeah.
you go live(viver) in five hours.

198
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,218
i'll be fine.

199
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,218
okay.

200
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,253
(retching)

201
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,253
okay.

202
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,489
reporter: donald trump
feeds his own narrative.

203
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,857
megyn: oh, fuck.
so nauseous.

204
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,124
if you can try
to keep(guarda) them(eles) down.

205
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,125
yeah.

206
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,561
(sighs) fuck.
stop making(fazer) that(este) face, julia.

207
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,996
i'm not making(fazer) a face.

208
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,698
megyn: (sighs) five hours?

209
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,966
lily: yeah.

210
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,966
okay.

211
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,706
don't worry.
we're behind(atrás) you.

212
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,841
chris: way behind(atrás) you.

213
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,778
there's a blanket
on the chair

214
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,680
and, just(somente) in case,
a trash can beside it.

215
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:04,884
host: welcome to the first
republican primary debate.

216
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,687
tonight's moderators
will be bret baier,

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,023
chris wallace and megyn kelly.

218
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,026
(audience cheering)

219
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:22,735
mr. trump, one of the things
people love(amar) about(cerca de) you

220
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,736
is you speak(falar) your(seu) mind

221
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,938
and you don't use
a politician's filter.

222
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,707
however, that(este) is not
without its downsides.

223
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,209
in particular,
when it comes to women.

224
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:35,080
you've called(chamado) women(mulheres) you don't
like, "fat pigs," "dogs,"

225
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,250
"slobs"
and "disgusting animals."

226
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,184
what is she doing?

227
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,887
your twitter account...

228
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,887
only rosie o'donnell.

229
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,155
(audience laughing(risonho) on tv)

230
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,155
great tv.

231
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,157
she knows(sabe) what(o que) she's doing.

232
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,726
your twitter account...

233
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,599
for the record, it was
well beyond rosie o'donnell.

234
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:54,800
trump: yes, i'm sure(claro) it was.

235
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,002
your twitter account has
several disparaging comments

236
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,671
about women's looks.

237
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,673
you once(uma vez) told(contado) a contestant
on celebrity apprentice

238
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,676
it would(seria) be a pretty(bonito) picture
to see her on her knees.

239
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,811
does that(este) sound to you
like the temperament

240
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,846
of a man we should(devemos) elect
as president?

241
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,114
and how will(vai) you
answer the charge

242
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,716
from hillary clinton...

243
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:10,716
she's calling(chamando) him out.

244
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,185
...who is likely
to be the democratic nominee,

245
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:16,288
that you are part(papel) of the war
on women?

246
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:20,125
call me stupid, but i thought
he'd respect the challenge.

247
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,295
trump is pissed.
he was up all night, tweeting.

248
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,264
crap. really?

249
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:26,365
lily: what(o que) was he tweeting?

250
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,268
"fox viewers give(dar) low marks
to bimbo @megynkelly."

251
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:30,236
ugh. i hate that(este) word.

252
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,171
yeah. it says(diz) you're too sexy
to be smart,

253
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,872
but not smart enough
to be sexy.

254
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,709
2:40 a.m. "wow, @megynkelly
really bombed tonight.

255
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,911
"people are going(vai) wild
on twitter! funny to watch."

256
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:42,281
3:07 a.m. "dear @megyn..."

257
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:42,281
go, trump. donald trump.

258
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:43,349
megyn: okay.

259
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,917
how many times(vezes) did he tweet?

260
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,652
like, 15.

261
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,087
yeah.

262
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,087
(megyn scoffs)

263
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,722
he's never(nunca) gonna(vai) be president.

264
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,792
wait. am i gonna(vai) be the story?

265
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:54,827
both: no.

266
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,329
i'm gonna(vai) be the story.

267
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,329
both: no.

268
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,998
no. no.

269
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,333
i can't let you go without
talking about(cerca de) donald trump.

270
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:03,168
megyn: gretchen's giving
this two blocks?

271
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,703
it's that
far down(baixa) the food chain?

272
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,038
we should(devemos) get you
a security(segurança) team.

273
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,139
think it over.

274
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,208
trump called(chamado) me
before the debate.

275
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:13,279
he said(disse) he knew(sabia) that(este) your
first question(pergunta) was harsh.

276
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,016
how could(poderia) he know(conhecer) that?

277
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,016
no idea.

278
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,217
i sure(claro) didn't.

279
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,821
(chuckles)

280
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:26,158
it was good(boa) tv.
unexpected.
goddamn tough.

281
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,727
proud of you, megyn.

282
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,363
thanks, roger.

283
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:32,398
heard you were(eram) sick.

284
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,033
yeah.

285
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,869
i think(pensar) it was my coffee.

286
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,837
where'd you get it?

287
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,837
my driver.

288
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,939
he insisted
on some(alguns) fancy coffee joint.

289
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,141
you know(conhecer) this(isto) guy?

290
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,743
no. he's a driver, roger.

291
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,345
did you know(conhecer) him?

292
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,345
no.

293
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,880
you know
better than(do que) that.

294
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,984
megyn: okay, yes,
roger ailes is paranoid.

295
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,019
but his parents were(eram) nuts.

296
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,020
as he drove off to college,

297
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,890
they filed for divorce,
and didn't tell(dizer) him.

298
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,426
at christmas, he came(veio) home
to find(achar) strangers in his house

299
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,427
and all his things,

300
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,430
photos and yearbooks
and trophies thrown out.

301
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,699
i mean, is it any wonder
the man created

302
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,367
a nostalgia machine
for lost america?

303
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:10,770
this is crazy.

304
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:13,806
we're sitting here(aqui) wondering

305
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,108
if a candidate for president
poisoned my coffee.

306
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,876
roger: it's only(só) crazy
until it happens.

307
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,412
and it happens.

308
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,847
i hate being(sendo) the story.

309
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,981
roger: i'll call(chamar) trump.

310
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,217
you go on vacation.
stay above(acima de) it all.

311
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,020
he won't dent your(seu) ratings.

312
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:31,857
nobody stops watching
because of a conflict.

313
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,759
they stop(pare) watching
when there(lá) isn't one.

314
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,194
some viewers will(vai) listen
to him.

315
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,329
well, some. but as long
as he keeps saying,

316
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,231
"megyn kelly is unwatchable,"

317
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:42,167
that means(significa) he's watching(assistindo) it.
they know(conhecer) that.

318
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,070
and they'll watch
what he watches.

319
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:45,905
you'll be okay.

320
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,274
megyn: see you in a week.

321
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:50,375
megyn: drink up, buddy boy.

322
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,410
(trump speaks indistinctly
on tv)

323
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,045
thank you.

324
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,748
here's to a week
of no kids, but my own.

325
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,615
gil: cheers.

326
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,615
cheers.

327
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,851
okay,
frank bruni in the times.

328
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,385
boo.

329
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,385
"the debate was riveting.

330
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,286
"it was admirable.

331
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,988
"it compels me
to write a cluster of words

332
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,289
"i never(nunca) imagined writing:

333
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:05,991
"hooray for fox news."

334
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:05,991
lily: wow.

335
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,092
well, that's gotta
make you happy,

336
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,994
praise all tangled up
in an insult.

337
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,329
it does(faz) make(fazer) me happy, gil.

338
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,097
trump: and, you know,
you could(poderia) see there(lá) was

339
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,332
blood coming(chegando) out of her eyes,

340
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,134
blood coming(chegando) out of her...

341
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,135
wherever.

342
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,135
no. oh, my god.

343
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,504
did he just(somente) accuse me
of anger-menstruating?

344
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,206
(cell phone(telefone) buzzing)

345
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,206
yes. are... um, yeah.

346
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,474
lily: yeah.

347
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,474
i'm calling(chamando) roger.

348
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:23,842
(cell phone(telefone) rings)

349
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:23,842
gil: no. i'll talk(conversa) to him.

350
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,177
take your(seu) vacation.
i'll handle this.

351
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,311
lily: oh, my god.

352
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,311
megyn: do you hear(ouvir) the phones?

353
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,379
doug.

354
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:28,280
lily: i have(ter) to call(chamar) you back.

355
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:29,514
would you like(como) to
correct yourself

356
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,818
on that(este) other(de outros) talking(conversando) point
about men being(sendo) dominant?

357
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,220
we don't have(ter) any time.
i wish we did.

358
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,421
we're running over,
we're running over.

359
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,991
yeah, well, hr is on the phone
'cause you called(chamado) me a skirt.

360
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,392
co-host: i gotta(preciso) read
that manual again.

361
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,895
gretchen:
i'll bring it to your(seu) office
right after(depois de) the show.

362
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,896
guest 1: some(alguns) guy came(veio) up
to me and said,

363
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,030
"i saw you on fox & friends
this morning.

364
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,800
"is gretchen as cute in person
as she is on tv?"

365
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,401
oh, come(venha) on.

366
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,401
and what(o que) did you answer him?

367
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,469
beautiful dress.

368
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,037
you look(olhar) wonderful.
great color.

369
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,405
in summary,
gretchen's beautiful.

370
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,840
beautiful. you look(olhar) beautiful.

371
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,809
well, you look(olhar) fabulous, too.

372
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,944
co-host: 'cause you gotta(preciso) wax?
does the waxing hurt?

373
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,813
uh, he looks at me for that!

374
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,347
co-host: we'll try that.
women are everywhere.

375
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,082
we're letting 'em play golf
and tennis now.

376
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,216
it's outta control.

377
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,216
you know(conhecer) what?

378
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,351
co-host: you know...
(chuckles) she's out.

379
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:10,189
you read the headlines,
since men are so great.

380
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,257
she needed a shower.

381
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,257
(clicks tv off)

382
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,993
the attitude off-camera
was even(até) worse.

383
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,929
steve simply started
ignoring me.

384
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,464
what did mr. ailes say
when you complained?

385
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,067
he said, "you act
like it only(só) rains on women.

386
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,138
"stop getting(obtendo) goddamn(maldito) offended
by everything.

387
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,406
"you're a man-hater."

388
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,543
and, um, "learn to get along
with the boys."

389
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:32,911
then he took(tomou) me off the show.

390
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,279
but gave(deu) you your(seu) own.

391
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,481
well, in the afternoon
dead zone.

392
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,350
i mean, it was a demotion
and we both(ambas) knew(sabia) it.

393
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:42,421
even though i did increase
the ratings by 15%.

394
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,824
(sighs) he moved me
to second(segundo) base.

395
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:46,992
back in minnesota,

396
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,862
before i graduated
summa cum laude from(a partir de) stanford,

397
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,997
before i was crowned
miss america,

398
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,398
i played second(segundo) base

399
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,467
in the sixth-grade
softball league.

400
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,638
i hate second(segundo) base.

401
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,607
did he ever(sempre) offer
to reverse that(este) decision

402
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,877
if you made(fez) yourself
sexually available?

403
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,478
not directly.

404
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,348
(clicks tongue) with(com) roger,
it's always(sempre) about(cerca de) loyalty.

405
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,884
he says(diz) he can fix things
if you're loyal.

406
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,286
and you can guess(acho) the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

407
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,422
we don't guess.

408
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,358
(sighs) oral sex.

409
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,792
roger likes to joke,

410
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,395
"to get ahead,
you gotta(preciso) give(dar) a little(pequena) head."

411
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,430
really.

412
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,498
but mr. ailes

413
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:29,501
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex?

414
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,404
i mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

415
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,573
like, "you're sexy
but you're too much(muito de) work."

416
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:35,908
you're... i mean...

417
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,111
i have(ter) a whole list in here

418
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,380
because that's just
how roger is.

419
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,681
what do you want
out of a lawsuit?

420
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:46,652
what do i want?
i want(querer) this(isto) behavior to stop.

421
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,454
someone has to speak(falar) up.
someone has to get mad.

422
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,556
well, that(este) may not be you.

423
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,492
your contract
will have(ter) a clause

424
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,928
requiring secret,
mandatory arbitration.

425
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,396
you familiar
with rudi bakhtiar's case?

426
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,164
gretchen: yes.

427
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,164
well, you're supposed to be.

428
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,568
my first(primeiro) act as
dc bureau chief...

429
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,404
i want(querer) you down(baixa) here
full-time.

430
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,940
oh, my god. (laughs)

431
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,508
that's amazing. yes.

432
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,143
you do know
what this(isto) means(significa) for you?

433
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,378
rudi: shit.
he doesn't think(pensar) i'm ready.

434
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,681
brian,
i will(vai) not let you down.

435
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,249
i'm gonna(vai) bust my ass for you.

436
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,384
well, rudi, come(venha) on,
that's a given.

437
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,186
rudi: so, what's the problem?

438
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,422
but, um...

439
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,559
look, you do get
how i feel(sentir) about(cerca de) you, right?

440
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,496
rudi: oh, fuck.
fuck, fuck, fuck.

441
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,099
well, i'm glad
you said(disse) that, brian,

442
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:35,634
because i really(verdade) respect
you, too.

443
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,937
no. no. i mean...

444
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,541
how i really(verdade) feel.

445
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,176
rudi: just(somente) look(olhar) confused.

446
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:47,112
all i want(querer) from(a partir de) you, rudi,

447
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,548
is to see the inside
of your(seu) hotel room.

448
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,117
rudi: god damn it.

449
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,585
that's all it's gonna(vai) take.

450
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,588
don't react.
make it your(seu) fault.

451
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,358
brian, if i've done(feito) anything

452
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,259
to make(fazer) you think
i feel(sentir) that(este) way about(cerca de) you,

453
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,128
i apologize.

454
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,196
friends.

455
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,464
we're friends.

456
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,732
professionals.

457
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,334
we have
a great(excelente) professional vibe.

458
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,635
now sell it.

459
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:11,502
i just(somente) don't do that.

460
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:13,372
i've never(nunca) had to do that
for a job.

461
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,506
i know, i know.

462
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,242
you know(conhecer) i'd kill for dc,

463
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,345
but there's no way
i'm showing you my hotel room.

464
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,348
this is gonna
ruin my career.

465
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,652
well, now i feel
like a creep.

466
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:30,756
no. (chuckles)
no, you're so not.

467
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,358
fucking creep.

468
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,364
they fired(disparamos) me.

469
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,067
i'm a lousy reporter
apparently. assholes.

470
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,339
nancy: she proved
what they(elas) wanted(desejado) her to prove.

471
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:50,242
no one really(verdade) wins
by suing(processamento) fox news.

472
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,310
neil: it's been(estive) our experience

473
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,646
that once(uma vez) you go public
in your(seu) job,

474
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,417
no one will(vai) hire you.

475
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,485
if you're able
to stick it out at fox,

476
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:01,586
gather more(mais) evidence,

477
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:06,558
you might be able to sue
ailes himself instead of fox.

478
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,726
and that(este) is why i'm here.

479
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,763
because marty hyman told(contado) me
that over(sobre) here(aqui) in new jersey,

480
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:15,367
i can avoid arbitration
by suing(processamento) roger personally.

481
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,569
he says(diz) that(este) you've managed
to change(mudança) the law,

482
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,237
and that(este) we could
call other(de outros) women

483
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,705
and show(mostrar) a pattern.

484
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,574
will other(de outros) women(mulheres) come(venha) forward?

485
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:23,842
gretchen: yes, they(elas) will.

486
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,244
you live(viver) and work(trabalhos) in new york.

487
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:28,213
roger has a house
in bergen county

488
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:30,082
where he stays
when he can't make(fazer) it upstate.

489
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,551
(chuckles) you do
your homework, ms. carlson.

490
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,220
no fingerprints.

491
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,489
that's how much(muito de) i practiced
the violin as a child.

492
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:39,357
if roger finds out
you came(veio) to us,

493
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,460
he won't just(somente) fire you.

494
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,460
gretchen: mmm.

495
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,696
he will(vai) bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

496
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,299
he will(vai) attack you personally.

497
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,234
these men, they(elas) care
more about(cerca de) their(deles) reputations

498
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,402
than they(elas) do money.

499
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,636
roger won't stop.

500
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,238
oh, i know. mmm-hmm.

501
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,238
nancy: you know(conhecer) that.

502
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,841
colleagues you admire
will say publicly

503
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,876
you're a superior,
ambitious woman

504
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:00,279
who's suing
because her career(carreira) stalled.

505
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,347
let 'em.

506
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:06,885
nancy: okay.

507
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:10,188
(chuckling) if we work(trabalhos) hard,
you might be lucky enough

508
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:11,823
to watch
the most(a maioria) powerful man in tv

509
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:13,658
go after(depois de) you
with everything(tudo) he's got.

510
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:15,360
(breathes deeply)

511
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,196
thank you.

512
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,196
(nancy chuckles)

513
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:22,634
i'm telling(dizendo) you,
other women(mulheres) will(vai) come(venha) forward.

514
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:25,537
let's hope.

515
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,405
kayla: frankly,
i think(pensar) you have(ter) a gap

516
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,474
in the network, mr. shine.

517
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:32,811
there are millions of young
conservatives in this(isto) country.

518
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,714
i mean, you can look(olhar) at my
instagram account. there(lá) are.

519
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,816
they don't have(ter) a voice
on our network.

520
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,887
i see myself as an influencer
in the jesus space.

521
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,321
and don't get me wrong,

522
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,457
i've learned a ton
from gretchen,

523
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,591
i truly have, of course.

524
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:49,261
but no judgment here,

525
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,164
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

526
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,267
it's just(somente) not that(este) helpful
to her.

527
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,270
i mean, to be honest,
mr. shine,

528
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,639
she's sort of establishment.

529
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,374
with a capital e.

530
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,910
that's why i wanted
to talk(conversa) to you in private.

531
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,846
kayla, before(antes de) we
move you up,

532
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,783
i want(querer) to ask you
something personal.

533
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:12,851
mmm.

534
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,221
what do you think
of our slogan,

535
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,523
"fair and balanced"?

536
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,525
i'm glad you asked.

537
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,394
look, our news(notícias) shows

538
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,429
and our opinion shows
are very(muito) different.

539
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:27,732
our news(notícias) is impartial,
it's top-of-the-line.

540
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,367
our opinion shows,

541
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,437
roger gave(deu) a voice
to people(pessoas) who didn't have(ter) one.

542
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,941
and he balanced
the american conversation.

543
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,811
so, our newspeople are fair.

544
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:44,449
our entertainers are a very
necessary form of balance.

545
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,888
attagirl. perfect.

546
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,391
gretchen: but today,
we're sticking up for girls

547
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,694
on international day
of the girl.

548
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,597
and, for the first(primeiro) time
on cable news, here(aqui) i am,

549
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,932
(chuckles)
makeup-free for a reason.

550
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:04,636
tomorrow i'll be back
in my regular makeup.

551
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:05,937
and i thank
the other(de outros) brave women

552
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,939
who came(veio) on today's show
sans makeup.

553
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:12,811
but let's continue to tell
our girls, "just be yourself."

554
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,945
shep.

555
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,945
(bell rings)

556
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:14,980
stage manager: and clear.

557
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:14,980
gretchen: yes.

558
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,414
(applause)

559
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,414
great show.

560
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:17,882
get me some(alguns) makeup.

561
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:17,882
(both chuckle)

562
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,651
(sighs) i have(ter) some(alguns) bad news.

563
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,787
kayla is leaving us
for the asshole.

564
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,256
gretchen: o'reilly?

565
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,256
rebekah: mmm-hmm.

566
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,992
it is our
highest-rated program.

567
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,627
and we can't be?

568
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,695
no, i believe
in real story, i do.

569
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,331
did you just(somente) see that(este) segment?
did you see it? did you see...

570
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:35,333
we're doing
something unique here.

571
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,269
kayla: mmm-hmm.

572
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,269
together. all of us.

573
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,437
(stammers) can you just...

574
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,437
rebekah: sure.

575
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,505
(whispers) listen(ouvir) to me.

576
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,409
i can get you
where you wanna(quer) be.

577
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,777
i can protect you.

578
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,012
just don't get ahead
of yourself.

579
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,347
you have(ter) a lot to learn.
i can teach you.

580
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,749
i'm not getting(obtendo) ahead
of myself, gretchen.

581
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,317
i'm taking the next step.

582
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,317
no. listen.

583
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,520
i learn by doing.

584
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,520
come on.
come on, please.

585
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,655
(sighs) i'm confused.

586
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,490
you want(querer) me to pass on
a promotion

587
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,294
so you can help(ajuda) me
get the same promotion

588
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,828
on a show(mostrar) with(com) worse ratings?

589
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,828
no. i just...

590
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,997
i want(querer) a little(pequena) loyalty.
i need(necessidade) loyalty.

591
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,399
women, together.

592
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,001
i'm loyal to the network.

593
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,001
all right.

594
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,603
it's not us versus them,
gretchen.

595
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,738
roger: miss(perder) america.

596
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,773
gretchen: roger.

597
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,408
hi, there.

598
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,510
this is a treat.

599
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,510
what the fuck(porra) are you doing?

600
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,413
a segment on how
we oversexualize women.

601
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,547
(scoffs)

602
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,582
i mean, you said
be more(mais) myself, so, ta-da.

603
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,017
roger: you know
what makeup(maquiagem) does?

604
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,819
keeps everybody
from seeing you sweat.

605
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:30,488
well, it's... most(a maioria) of
the mean(significar) tweets that(este) i receive

606
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,923
are about(cerca de) my appearance,

607
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,558
so it is important
that we fight(lutar) back

608
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:34,626
against this(isto) kind of bullying.

609
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,061
bullying isn't meanness.

610
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,729
bullying is
people with(com) more(mais) power

611
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,364
hitting people(pessoas) with(com) less.

612
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,099
these jackasses
have cellphones.

613
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,868
you have(ter) a fucking(porra) tv show!

614
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,105
we have(ter) to fight
the objectification of women.

615
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,406
oh, bullshit.

616
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,042
listen,
mouth shut, ears open.

617
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,011
nobody wants(quer) to watch
a middle-aged woman

618
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,612
sweat her way
through menopause.

619
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:55,546
what? (scoffs)

620
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,816
(loudly) not on
national fucking(porra) television!

621
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,352
thank you for the advice.

622
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,387
(groans) objectification.

623
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:04,856
(sighs)

624
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:04,856
(door opens)

625
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:06,858
(door closes)

626
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:08,960
gretchen: all right.

627
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,395
gretchen,
i really(verdade) appreciate...

628
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:11,430
gretchen: shut up.

629
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,766
good luck.

630
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,042
player: drift.

631
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:26,478
go, go, go!

632
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:28,980
whoo! good(boa) one, honey.

633
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,482
ooh, ooh, ooh.

634
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,717
(cell phone(telefone) vibrates)

635
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:37,989
hey.

636
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,524
it's a zoo here.

637
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:40,792
the phone's ringing
off the hook.

638
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,561
anyone care
he called(chamado) me a bimbo?

639
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:44,662
not really.

640
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:46,898
he tweeted the gq photo.

641
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:46,898
megyn: i saw.

642
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:48,767
lily: and?

643
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:48,767
torn.

644
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,437
god, i'd love
to be slut-shamed.

645
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,873
gil wants(quer) to ask again
if we should(devemos) make(fazer) a statement.

646
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,142
no. no response. zero.

647
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,710
(groans)

648
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,579
doug just(somente) lost.
i gotta(preciso) go.

649
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,715
next time, honey.

650
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:04,883
nice.

651
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,018
good game.

652
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,018
trump, '16.

653
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,888
doug: excuse(com licença) me.

654
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,423
you talk(conversa) to my wife again,

655
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,991
i will(vai) beat you
to a fucking(porra) pulp.

656
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:16,995
that was weird.

657
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:16,995
mmm-hmm.

658
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:19,030
(sighs)

659
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,765
you're getting(obtendo) some(alguns) action.

660
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:21,900
oh, really?

661
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,002
(waves crashing)

662
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,002
(seagulls calling)

663
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,546
(grunts)

664
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,546
oh, man.

665
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,148
(chuckles)

666
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,148
asshole.

667
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:38,716
you don't have(ter) to worry
about trump.

668
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,585
you're tougher
than all those(essa) guys, okay?

669
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,786
you just(somente) gotta(preciso) worry
about the crazies.

670
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,188
i can handle a few crazies.

671
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,188
i know.

672
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,322
yardley: mommy.

673
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,624
trump will(vai) stop(pare) once(uma vez) he feels
he's won the argument.

674
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:48,126
i feel(sentir) like
he's less(menos) interested

675
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,462
in winning the argument

676
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,598
than just(somente) having the argument
with you in public

677
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,467
to prove(provar) he can
take on the establishment.

678
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,135
i'm not the establishment.

679
00:23:57,168 --> 00:24:00,472

680
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,973
yardley: mommy!

681
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,973

you do understand
i have(ter) to be
above this, right?

683
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,647
i have(ter) to be an anchor(âncora) first,
then a woman.

684
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,982
you know(conhecer) the entire country

685
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:13,685

00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,653
yardley: mommy!

687
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,653

00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,522
yardley: there's a man.

689
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,522
both: what?

690
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,123
megyn: yardley!

691
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,123
look. he's right(direito) there.

692
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,792
yardley, where(onde) is he?

693
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:20,792
yardley: look. there(lá) he is.

694
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,026
oh, jesus.
he's got a fucking(porra) camera!

695
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,094
megyn: come(venha) here, honey.

696
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,195
no, no, no!
don't open the door.

697
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:25,563
they can't sell them
if we're inside.

698
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:26,931
get out. get out of here! go!

699
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:27,966
are you okay?

700
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,902
what were
you guys(pessoal) doing?

701
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,106
mommy and daddy?

702
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,106
mmm-hmm.

703
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,742
um... (stammers)
it was a crossword...

704
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,878
mommy was just(somente) taking
a quick little(pequena) nap.

705
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,746
quick one.

706
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,746
it wasn't that(este) quick.

707
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,149
i'm gonna(vai) have(ter) to
call roger about(cerca de) security.

708
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,818
michael savage: (on radio)
it's as clear(claro) as a bell

709
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,554
that mayhem kelly has
gone over(sobre) to the dark side.

710
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,289
the more(mais) she sells out,

711
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:53,191
the wider
her nostrils have(ter) become.

712
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,026
listen to
what i've just(somente) said(disse) to you.

713
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:55,927
he's here.

714
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,129
savage:
this woman(mulher) was once(uma vez) pretty,

715
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,731
and the more(mais) she has sold out,

716
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,099
the wider
her nostrils have(ter) become.

717
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,667
they're almost porcine.

718
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,669
she snorts her insults
at america...

719
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:05,937
roger!

720
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,772
...and, as i say, it's now
the portrait of dorian kelly,

721
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,207
not the portrait
of dorian gray.

722
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,677
give me a day to figure out
how we hit trump(trunfo) back.

723
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,811
stop by later. (grunts)

724
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:15,647
i don't want(querer) my kids
hearing this(isto) crap.

725
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,249
ignore the damn morons.

726
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:19,751
i'm old, fat, and ugly.

727
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,153
christ,
they call(chamar) me jabba the hutt.

728
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:26,624
hemophilia swells my joints.
can't exercise.

729
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,927
i feel(sentir) fine,
but i look(olhar) like(como) shit.

730
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,229
i look(olhar) the opposite
of how i feel.

731
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:34,533
do i let it affect me?
no, i do not.

732
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,735
megyn:
this isn't entirely true.

733
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,170
roger is also fat

734
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,838
because he'll get
a room-service menu

735
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:41,940
and order page two.

736
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,008
no goddamn(maldito) orange on fox!

737
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,843
but he cares a lot
about looks.

738
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:47,145
fucking idiots.

739
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,080
let's turn our attention
to south korea.

740
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,248
south korean officials say

741
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:53,017
talks with(com) the north have
adjourned until(até) tomorrow...

742
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,319
megyn: early on, he realized

743
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,354
for a network(rede) to stay on
24 hours a day,

744
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,957
you need(necessidade) something
to hold an audience.

745
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,158
joining me to discuss

746
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,960
the korean peninsula
is seth choy...

747
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,862
megyn: that(este) something(alguma coisa) is legs.

748
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:06,765
there's a reason
for clear(claro) desks.

749
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:10,702
we need(necessidade) you
in a shorter dress.

750
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,836
kimberly: but you know
that they're gonna(vai) take...

751
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,872
roger: wide shot! wider!

752
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,673
go to the wide shot!

753
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,375
i want(querer) to see
her goddamn(maldito) legs.

754
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,310
why the fuck
do you think(pensar) i hired her?

755
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:20,712
kimberly: but this(isto) might
be seen(visto) by racial activists

756
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,047
purely
through the racial prism.

757
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,385
uh, stand up
and give(dar) me a spin.

758
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,821
really?

759
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,821
yeah, it's a visual medium.

760
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,962
yeah.
that's good. sit down.

761
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:39,831
i support the wall. i do.

762
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,000
but mass deportations,
come on.

763
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,101
that'll never(nunca) work

764
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,336
because of the 14th amendment.
you want(querer) me to quote(citar) it?

765
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,871
"if you were(eram) born in america,

766
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:48,873
"you're an american, period.
period."

767
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:50,842
get me
a demographically friendly

768
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,777
hispanic woman(mulher) on immigration.

769
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,180
but, hey, she needs(precisa) to be
very demographically friendly.

770
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,750
okay. uh, new girl's up.
kayla.

771
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,285
hi, sir.

772
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,354
so, i was listening to
rush limbaugh this(isto) morning.

773
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:06,224
he said(disse) something(alguma coisa) kind of cool
about anthony weiner.

774
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,260
how he's an exhibitionist
in every(todo) aspect

775
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,963
of how he presents himself
politically.

776
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,031
(whispers) oh, my god.

777
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,932
o'reilly: is she the best
you can do?

778
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:18,069
producer: bill(projeto de lei) shine(brilhar) asked(perguntou) us
to give(dar) her a try, so...

779
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,272
o'reilly: okay, let's not lose
focus. back(de volta) to immigration.

780
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,441
oh, my gosh.

781
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,842
i can't get fired.

782
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,812
this is the only(só) job
i have(ter) ever(sempre) wanted.

783
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:31,049
i don't wanna(quer) be on tv,
i wanna(quer) be on fox.

784
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,918
jess: uh-huh.

785
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,918
my family, every(todo) day,

786
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,354
every holiday,
especially holidays,

787
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:37,822
they watch(ver) fox news.

788
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,691
we're like(como) addicts.

789
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,025
fox is how we do church.

790
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,326
you know(conhecer) when(quando) they(elas) made
the corner logo turn...

791
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,460
the bug.

792
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,064
...because folks had "fox"
burned into(em) their(deles) tv screens?

793
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,198
that's us.

794
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,800
kayla,
you're not getting(obtendo) fired.

795
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,268
he cannot scale his anger.

796
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,936
he's a perpetual
outrage machine.

797
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,172
that's why crazies love(amar) him.
no offense to your(seu) family.

798
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,474
you want(querer) to do the folders?
no crying at fox.

799
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,709
no crying.

800
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,947
let me explain
your mistake here.

801
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,949
so, rush is on hannity's team.

802
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,118
they're the competition.
they're gop party hacks.

803
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:08,720
so, he thinks
he's way ahead(à frente) of them,

804
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,955
so steal from(a partir de) drudge
and breitbart, not talk(conversa) radio.

805
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:11,923
okay.

806
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,825
also, stop(pare) worrying
if the story's legit.

807
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,892
if you can't source it,

808
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,828
just go with,
"some are saying."

809
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,929
seriously?

810
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:20,765
you have(ter) to adopt

811
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,400
the mentality of
an irish street cop.

812
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,436
the world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

813
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,871
minorities are criminals,

814
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,740
sex is sick,
but interesting.

815
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,142
ask yourself, "what would
scare my grandmother,

816
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,077
"or piss off my grandfather?"

817
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,747
and that's a fox story.
are you writing this(isto) down?

818
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,948
oh, it makes
so much(muito de) sense.

819
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,316
jess: frighten, titillate.

820
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,316
right.

821
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,519
jess: frighten, titillate.
frighten, titillate.

822
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:42,920
when you're starting
the story,

823
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:44,222
you need(necessidade) to start
with a clear(claro) villain.

824
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,890
(clears throat)

825
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,890
(inhales deeply)

826
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:48,059
liberal judge,
pinhead mayor,

827
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,294
vermont, hollywood.

828
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,294
uh-huh.

829
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:51,996
conservatives
want to conserve.

830
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,165
uh-huh.

831
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,165
you're the last(durar) defense

832
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,302
against jesus-hating,
trans-loving,

833
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:01,939
clinton-controlled
armageddon, baby.

834
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,908
oh, come(venha) on.

835
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:06,811
you do believe
some of that, right?

836
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,413
yeah.

837
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,915
uh...

838
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,818
(chuckles)

839
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,255
(chuckles)

840
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,823
(sighs) that's quite a face
you have.

841
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,391
really?

842
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:22,127
(jess chuckles)

843
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:22,127
thank you.

844
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,495
(whispers) i'm drunk.

845
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:25,997
i'm drunk as well.

846
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,465
(both giggling)

847
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,507
you have(ter) a hillary poster
in your(seu) house.

848
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:38,042
i guess(acho) i do.

849
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,879
okay, my parents
would be horrified

850
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,281
if i went home
with a democrat.

851
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,418
the lesbianism, however?

852
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,053
oh, i'm not a lesbian.

853
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,156
i'm not a democrat.

854
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,156
(chuckles)

855
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:55,460
i just(somente) have(ter) two giant
hillary posters in my kitchen.

856
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,830
as a joke, though, right?

857
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,833
no. that's who
i'd like(como) to be the president.

858
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,601
are you serious?

859
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,204
i'm a closeted democrat.

860
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,839
at fox news?

861
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,540
oh, my god.
i thought that(este) you knew(sabia) that.

862
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,443
no, i didn't know(conhecer) that.
does anyone(alguém) know(conhecer) that?

863
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:15,046
(whispers) can you not tell?
you can't tell(dizer) anyone.

864
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,815
of course(curso) i won't tell.

865
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,815
no, i'm so serious.

866
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,117
can i ask something?

867
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,117
mmm-hmm.

868
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:22,520
why do you work(trabalhos) at fox?

869
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,091
why don't you work
at msnbc or something?

870
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:31,329
i think(pensar) i, like,
thrive in toxic environments.

871
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,498
i never(nunca) know
if you're kidding or not.

872
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:35,233
i am kidding.

873
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,435
i applied everywhere

874
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,604
and i got a job at fox.

875
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,873
and i keep(guarda) applying
to other(de outros) places

876
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,876
and they(elas) keep(guarda) not taking me
because i work(trabalhos) at fox.

877
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,445
(sighs)

878
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:48,913
oh, my gosh.

879
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,382
it's okay.

880
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,951
one day i'm gonna(vai) be free.

881
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:55,119
what? it's not that(este) bad.

882
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:58,356
if you're gay,
it's pretty(bonito) bad.

883
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,325
well, yeah, you don't
wanna be gay at fox.

884
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:04,996
you work(trabalhos) for bill(projeto de lei) o'reilly
and you have(ter) a hillary poster?

885
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,964
you do know(conhecer) he likes to

886
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,999
call up female producers
and whack off, right?

887
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,100
bill?

888
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,501
yes, bill.

889
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:11,635
no.

890
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,638
you haven't heard(ouvi) about
the andrea mackris lawsuit?

891
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,907
no.

892
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,907
oh, my god.

893
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,475
this should(devemos) be
in the welcome packet.

894
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,977
she was one of
his associate producers.

895
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,146
he took(tomou) her,
and only(só) her,

896
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,614
to the republican
national convention.

897
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:25,349
called her up at 11:00,

898
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:26,350
touching himself

899
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:28,352
and telling(dizendo) her
what he wanted(desejado) to do to her

900
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,087
with the old falafel.

901
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,323
(chuckling)

902
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,323
are you kidding?

903
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,125
it's on the internet.

904
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:38,129
and then, quote, "using
a vibrator upon himself."

905
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,399
like, he brought a vibrator
from home(casa) to the convention?

906
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,700
yes, well, you have(ter) to bring

907
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,168
a vibrator from(a partir de) home
to the convention.

908
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,470
(laughing)

909
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:49,307
the question(pergunta) is, what(o que) does
a man do with(com) a vibrator?

910
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,409
(both laugh)

911
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,978
do you place it
alongside the shaft?

912
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,580
(imitates whirring)

913
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,582
(speaks indistinctly)

914
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:00,651
i don't wanna(quer) hear(ouvir) that.

915
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:02,253
"fucking die, bitch."

916
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,123
"if i see you,
you better(melhor) run."

917
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,160
"i wouldn't be sleeping
too soundly if i were(eram) you."

918
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:11,195
trump's lit the torches.

919
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,597
you're getting
security tonight.

920
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,667
all i want(querer) is for this
to go away, roger.

921
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,636
look, every(todo) general in history

922
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,939
has gone into(em) battle
feeling the same.

923
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,209
right.

924
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,280
i'll read a statement
at the top, saying,

925
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:32,350
"yes, trump(trunfo) is attacking me,
but i'm not going(vai) to respond."

926
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,018
any defense
will come(venha) from(a partir de) you.

927
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:39,290
not right(direito) now.

928
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,260
you set a record
on viewer email.

929
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:44,295
megyn: let me guess.

930
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:46,597
none of it on my side.

931
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,299
no.

932
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:50,101
our audience(público) loves trump.

933
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,270
a hell of a lot more
than the murdochs realize.

934
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:55,006
(chuckles)
more than(do que) trump(trunfo) knows.

935
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,142
he's tweeting
we made(fez) peace.

936
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:00,344
he'll come(venha) on fox & friends
tomorrow.

937
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:02,346
he needs(precisa) us.
we need(necessidade) him.

938
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:03,715
it's got nothing
to do with(com) you.

939
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,652
all right. it's late.

940
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:10,355
i have(ter) dogs to feed.

941
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,193
(buzzer sounds)

942
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,193
(door opens)

943
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,495
(door closes)

944
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:19,697
(sighs)

945
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,606
(sighs) just(somente) to be clear,

946
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,110
i will(vai) not be
kissing trump's ass at 9:00.

947
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:36,180
(sighs) we fight
tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

948
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:37,248
(buzzer sounds)

949
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,285
(door closes)

950
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,254
(clears throat)

951
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:49,761
can i see
that statement(demonstração) again, bill?

952
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,665
heard there(lá) was a dust-up
involving yours truly

953
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:57,068
and presidential contender
donald trump.

954
00:33:58,368 --> 00:33:59,470
how you doing, megyn?

955
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,307
hanging in there.

956
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,344
cameraman:
give him hell, megyn.

957
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,017
(bell rings)

958
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,485
stage manager:
okay, quiet on the set.

959
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:18,056
we go live(viver) in five, four,
three, two...

960
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:21,092
i just(somente) got back
from a weekend at the beach

961
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,193
with my husband
and my three kids.

962
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,128
did anything(nada) happen
in the news(notícias) while i was gone?

963
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,596
(crew chuckling)

964
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,596
you may have(ter) heard

965
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,465
there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

966
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,633
and presidential contender
donald trump.

967
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,736
mr. trump(trunfo) was upset
with a question(pergunta) i asked...

968
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:35,406
oh, cute baby. (chuckles)

969
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:38,109
i gotta(preciso) say,
i can't stand your(seu) show.

970
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,710
oh.

971
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:41,345
you guys(pessoal) at fox,

972
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,482
you're doing(fazendo) terrible things
to our country.

973
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,384
well, i hope
that makes you feel(sentir) better.

974
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,653
how you treat
people you disagree with

975
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:51,522
says everything(tudo) about(cerca de) you.

976
00:34:58,695 --> 00:34:59,763
(exhales)

977
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:02,466
you know, i mean, jesus was
a white(branco) man too, you know?

978
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:04,168
it's like,
he was an historical figure.

979
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,436
i mean,
that's a verifiable fact.

980
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,738
as is santa. i just(somente) want(querer) the
kids watching(assistindo) to know(conhecer) that.

981
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:10,374
but my point is,
how do you just(somente) revise it

982
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,176
and change(mudança) santa
from white(branco) to black?

983
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,744
news presenter:
i mean, you can't. not really.

984
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:18,883
jess: wow.

985
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,651

986
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:23,187

wear that(este) to sunday service.

987
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,222
please. i have(ter) church jeans,

988
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:27,625
so i can hold a latte
on my knee.

989
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,761
jess: oh, my god. kayla.

990
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,363

991
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,363

992
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,901
(both chuckle)

993
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,236
(in deep voice) i'm a creep.

994
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,739
that is gross.

995
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,739

996
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,475
jess: (chuckling) i love(amar) that.

998
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,914

999
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,150

00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:56,253

no one.

1003
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,171
i feel(sentir) for you.

1004
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,806

1008
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,416
sugar does(faz) make
everybody crazy.

1009
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,750
no, these(esses) aren't donuts
he eats.

1010
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:29,253
they're donuts he throws.
at somebody.

1011
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,589
(laughs)

1012
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:35,693

1017
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:46,003
sure.

1018
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,571
(buzzer sounds)

1019
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:48,839
(tv playing indistinctly)

1020
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:52,810
that's roger's
private elevator.

1021
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,214
hang on a sec.

1022
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,214
(buzzer sounds)

1023
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,620
(buzzer sounds)

1024
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,924
roger: mmm-hmm.

1025
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,293
kayla: hello.

1026
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:11,395
ah, have(ter) a seat.

1027
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:11,395
kayla: thank(obrigado) you.

1028
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,566
liberals don't get megyn.

1029
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,936
she's a star not because
she thinks santa's white,

1030
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,971
but because(porque) she'll say it.

1031
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,971
that's right.

1032
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:23,474
yeah, few have(ter) courage
in the spotlight.

1033
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,942
it's powerful to watch.

1034
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,544
and she went up 30%
that quarter.

1035
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:29,647
(chuckling) well, that, too.

1036
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,883
all audiences want
is authenticity.

1037
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,618
mmm.

1038
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,618
for 200 years,

1039
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:35,986
santa's a fat white(branco) guy.

1040
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,755
they think(pensar) santa,

1041
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,856
that's what(o que) they(elas) see.

1042
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,856
right.

1043
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,724
you want(querer) to
change that? fine.

1044
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:43,827
let's discuss it without(sem) you
calling my people(pessoas) racist.

1045
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,961
exactly.

1046
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,765
a liberal is somebody
who wants(quer) to live(viver) in a future

1047
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,800
that he is too lazy

1048
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,703
or too arrogant
to actually create.

1049
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:55,939
well, in my family,
santa's always(sempre) been(estive) white

1050
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:59,376
and, according to my
granddaddy, a communist.

1051
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:00,678
(laughing)

1052
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,880
so, that's my family.

1053
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:07,351
so, what(o que) can i do
for you, kayla?

1054
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:10,087
why did you
drop by to see me?

1055
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,089
well, the thing(coisa) is, sir,

1056
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,491
i actually started on-air
during college

1057
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,627
in central florida. weather.

1058
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,463
(sighs) i want
to convince you

1059
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:22,433
that that(este) is
where i belong,
mr. ailes.

1060
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,768
i think(pensar) i'd be freakin'
phenomenal on your(seu) network.

1061
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:27,505
well, it's
mr. murdoch's air,

1062
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:32,009
but i did create it.
i do run it.

1063
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,077
right.

1064
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,545
you have(ter) a pretty(bonito) face.

1065
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:39,383
here, uh, stand up
and give(dar) me a twirl.

1066
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:40,517
now?

1067
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,619
yeah.
just a quick spin.

1068
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,088
oh. sure. (chuckles)

1069
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,633
that's very(muito) good.

1070
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,633
(chuckles)

1071
00:38:56,666 --> 00:39:01,405
now, uh, pull your(seu) dress(vestir) up
and let me see your(seu) legs.

1072
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,012
um...

1073
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,651
(chuckles awkwardly)

1074
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:17,088
it's a visual medium, kayla.

1075
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:20,124
come on.

1076
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,067
higher.

1077
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,852
come on. higher.

1078
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,866
(breathes heavily)

1079
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,402
(grunts)

1080
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:10,908
(breathing shakily)

1081
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,143
that's fine, kayla.

1082
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,781
why don't you
sit down?

1083
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:29,159
thank you.

1084
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,194
mmm-hmm.

1085
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:33,764
you have(ter) a great(excelente) body.

1086
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:34,899
thank you.

1087
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:41,439
mr. ailes...

1088
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:46,477
i'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this...

1089
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,612
no, no, of course.

1090
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,612
...to anyone.

1091
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:50,047
i'm here(aqui) to help
my employees,

1092
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,483
not hurt them.

1093
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,483
it would(seria) just(somente) sound...

1094
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,486
anything that
happens here,
in this(isto) room,

1095
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,689
is strictly
between you and me.

1096
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,125
okay.

1097
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,125
of course,
it cuts both(ambas) ways.

1098
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:03,928
i'm discreet,

1099
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,598
but unforgiving.

1100
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:20,010
(sighs) success in
broadcast television

1101
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,813
is hard.
it's arbitrary.

1102
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:25,483
this is the most(a maioria) competitive
industry on earth.

1103
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,185
you understand
what i'm saying?

1104
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:29,587
mmm-hmm.

1105
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,622
we could(poderia) work(trabalhos) together.

1106
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,827
i could(poderia) pluck you out
and move you

1107
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,929
all the way
to the front of the line.

1108
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,733
but i want
something in return.

1109
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,206
do you know
what that(este) is, kayla?

1110
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,912
(stammers)

1111
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,912
loyalty.

1112
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,883
i need(necessidade) to know
that you're loyal.

1113
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,622
i need(necessidade) you
to find(achar) a way
to prove(provar) it.

1114
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:07,324
mmm-hmm.

1115
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,026
you think(pensar) about(cerca de) that,
all right?

1116
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:16,767
so, we'll talk(conversa) again?

1117
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,638
faye can show(mostrar) you
the way out.

1118
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,306
thank you, sir.

1119
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,247
(people speaking(falando) indistinctly)

1120
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:46,897
jess. jess.

1121
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:54,972
something really(verdade) weird
just happened.

1122
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,876
i just(somente) went
to say hi to...

1123
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:03,814
i just... i met...
i was invited to meet roger.

1124
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,917
i mean, nothing...

1125
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,686
nothing happened.

1126
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:10,921
(whispers) kayla.

1127
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,691
it's actually
better for you

1128
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:16,060
if you don't
involve me in this.

1129
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,764
um, 'cause they(elas) know
that we're friends.

1130
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,300
i'm sorry.

1131
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:25,235
okay.

1132
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:27,237
this place is crazy.

1133
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,682
protestors: (chanting)
no trump. no kkk.

1134
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:39,983
no fascist usa.

1135
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,952
doug: jesus.

1136
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,952
megyn: okay, we're here.

1137
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:43,654
julia: (over phone)
his assistant's name is rhona.

1138
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,288
the security(segurança) guard is keith...

1139
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:46,356
got it.

1140
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,059
gil, last(durar) words?

1141
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:51,028
gil: yeah, don't piss him off.
i need(necessidade) this(isto) job.

1142
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:52,796
good luck.

1143
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:54,131
i'll be waiting
right here, okay?

1144
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,036
(protestors continue chanting)

1145
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:06,410
man: are you
happy now, bitch?

1146
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,448
trump: (on tv) during(durante) the day,
if i'm in the office,

1147
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,216
i have(ter) a number of people

1148
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:14,751
that i'll just(somente) call(chamar) out
a tweet to.

1149
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:16,019
it's always(sempre) my right.

1150
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:16,019
(megyn chuckles(risos) on tv)

1151
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,788
you probably had some(alguns) pretty
nasty tweets sent your(seu) way.

1152
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,922
i don't want(querer) that(este) to happen.

1153
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:20,156
i have(ter) fans
that really(verdade) love...

1154
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,026
but you retweet
some of those.
it's not just(somente) the fans.

1155
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:24,695
trump: but not
the more(mais) nasty ones.

1156
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,830
you would(seria) be amazed
at the ones i don't retweet.

1157
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,398
"bimbo"?

1158
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:31,935
uh, well, that(este) was a retweet.
yeah, did i say that?

1159
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:34,705
many times.

1160
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:34,705
ooh, okay. excuse(com licença) me.

1161
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,273
(megyn chuckles)

1162
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,275
trump: but not the most
horrible thing, you know.

1163
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,911
over your(seu) life, megyn, you've
been called(chamado) a lot worse.

1164
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,479
is that(este) right?

1165
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,479
all right, that's enough.

1166
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:44,247
it's not about(cerca de) me.
it's not about(cerca de) me.

1167
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,216
well, what(o que) do you think?

1168
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,020
i think
you're too solicitous.

1169
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:51,888
thank you.

1170
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:54,124
but this(isto) once, i can handle
a straight-up positive.

1171
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:55,859
doug: i'm sorry.

1172
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:55,859
megyn: yeah.

1173
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:59,262
he attacks you
for a year(ano) straight

1174
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:02,165
and you let him off
with a fucking(porra) "oops."

1175
00:45:02,198 --> 00:45:04,267
megyn: what?
i don't let him off.

1176
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,838
i confront him.
i used donald trump.

1177
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,840
honey, you absolved him.

1178
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,174
doug, there(lá) are internal

1179
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:12,909
political pressures
at play here(aqui) as well.

1180
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:14,778
yeah, yeah. i bet.
i get it, gil.

1181
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:16,246
you know(conhecer) what,
can we have(ter) a second, guys?

1182
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,448
please.

1183
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,952
(door opens)

1184
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,920
i'm not trying
to be critical.

megyn: well, you are.
i made(fez) this(isto) go away.

1186
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:29,159
i stopped his
harassing bullshit. for us.

1187
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:31,461
i never
asked you to do that.

1188
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:32,763
he is going(vai) to be

1189
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,397
the republican(republicano) candidate
for president.

1190
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,266
i'm a news(notícias) anchor.
i need(necessidade) access to him.

1191
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,969
you need(necessidade) access?
at what(o que) fucking(porra) price?

1192
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,939
at what(o que) price? the price
of our apartment. my salary.

1193
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:45,309
that pays our fucking(porra) bills.

1194
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:57,220
look. for the record...

1195
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:57,220
no. you know(conhecer) what?

1196
00:45:57,253 --> 00:45:58,789
it's been(estive) a shitty year!

1197
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:01,858
really fucking(porra) shitty year,

1198
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:04,060
and i'm allowed
to want(querer) it over.

1199
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:05,195
(sighs heavily)

1200
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:06,296
you are.

1201
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:09,900
fuck.

1202
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,435
so, what(o que) i'm saying(dizendo) is,
do we really(verdade) need(necessidade) ar-15s

1203
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:14,070
to be able to hunt deer,

1204
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:15,138
protect our families?

1205
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:19,476
i'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

1206
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,444
some of these(esses) mass shootings
would have(ter) been(estive) less(menos) deadly

1207
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:22,913
if that(este) had been(estive) the case.

1208
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,216
but i'm also with
the majority today,

1209
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:29,553
taking a stand against
semiautomatic assault weapons.

1210
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,421
which brings us back
to the question(pergunta) of the day.

1211
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:35,959
should congress reinstate
the assault weapons ban?

1212
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:38,328
i know(conhecer) a lot of you
don't agree with(com) me.

1213
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,030
that's fine.

1214
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:42,933
huh.

1215
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,402
89% of you say no.

1216
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,373
and that's what(o que) makes
america great.

1217
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:51,908
(bell rings)

1218
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:53,577

1261
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:02,532

man: good(boa) luck, ms. carlson.

1275
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:48,211
gretchen: do you know(conhecer) why
we dress(vestir) soldiers the same?

1276
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:50,380
so everybody(todo o mundo) knows
they're replaceable.

1277
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:51,715
(people speaking(falando) indistinctly)

so, this(isto) employee
has sued roger personally.

1301
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,814
he doesn't know
who she is.

1302
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:00,817
are you familiar
with ms. carlson?

1303
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,253
no. until(até) two hours ago,
i'd never(nunca) heard(ouvi) of her.

1304
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,156
more importantly, no one heard
from her after(depois de) she was fired.

1305
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,158
wait. not even
to negotiate
a severance?

1306
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,392
no. and that(este) suggests

1307
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:12,262
she knew(sabia) it was coming
and she had a plan.

1308
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,731
as news(notícias) corp attorney,
i recommend you conduct

1309
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,300

1355
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,349
thank you. thank(obrigado) you.

1356
00:54:19,655 --> 00:54:20,723
what is that?

1357
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:23,360
oh, uh,
just grocery-store sushi.

1358
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,295
mmm.

1359
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,998
sushi's not liberal food.

1360
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:30,933
i didn't say that(este) it was.

1361
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:32,502
(cell phone(telefone) vibrates)

1362
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,105
hi, love.

1363
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,808
roger: go home(casa) right(direito) now
and don't talk(conversa) to anybody.

1364
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:40,576
what? wait, roger...

1365
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:43,613
i'm leaving now.
go home. i'll meet you there.

1366
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,715
what?

1367
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,715
reporter 1: fox news(notícias) host
gretchen carlson

1368
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:48,584
has filed a lawsuit(processo judicial) against
the network's ceo roger ailes,

1369
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:50,453
claiming she was fired
because she was...

1370
00:54:50,486 --> 00:54:53,389
fox news(notícias) chairman roger ailes
is responding to a lawsuit

1371
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:55,692
filed by lawyers
for gretchen carlson...

1372
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:56,893
reporter:
alleges she was fired

1373
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,695
after turning down
sexual advances.

1374
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,096
reporter 2:
carlson claimed in the lawsuit

1375
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,732
that ailes took(tomou) her off
the popular morning(manhã) show,

1376
00:55:02,765 --> 00:55:04,901
fox & friends, in 2013,

1377
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,769
cut her pay and placed her

1378
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:09,505
in a less(menos) desirable
afternoon time(tempo) slot

1379
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:10,907
because she refused to have

1380
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,842
a sexual relationship
with him.

1381
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,412
the lawsuit(processo judicial) was filed
in new jersey state court.

1382
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,349
(dog barking)

1383
00:55:23,452 --> 00:55:25,888
champ's making(fazer) his rounds.

1384
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:26,923
guard: good(boa) boy.

1385
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:29,025
are you okay?

1386
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:31,795
no.

1387
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:42,939
(sighs)

1388
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:46,876
jeanine: beth,
i just(somente) talked to thewrap.

1389
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,612
it's an online publication.
i said, how sad it is

1390
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:52,515
we've got this(isto) woman
making these(esses) complaints

1391
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:55,418
when there(lá) are real victims
out there.

1392
00:55:55,451 --> 00:55:57,019
i know, roger.
i told(contado) people(pessoas) magazine

1393
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:59,722
we've been(estive) in your(seu) office
alone a lot over(sobre) 15 years.

1394
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,557
i've never(nunca) seen(visto) anything
like what(o que) i'm reading about.

1395
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,126
i said, "i don't think
gretchen carlson

1396
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,060
"has a friend
in the building."

1397
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,928
i know, roger.
someone would've told(contado) me.

1398
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:07,163
they're gonna(vai) quote(citar) me
on that.

1399
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:08,331
not a ring of truth.

1400
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,434
maria bartiromo
sent variety a stock chart.

1401
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:12,935
oh, hey, we're up.

1402
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:12,935
julia: whoo-hoo.

1403
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,538
lily: hannity tweeted,
"i talked to hundreds of women
at fox this(isto) week,

1404
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,773
"both on air and off.

1405
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,441
"they say it all bs."

1406
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:19,976
julia: brit hume, too.

1407
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:19,976
megyn: brit?

1408
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,978
"why didn't gretchen
quit and sue

1409
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,013
"instead of suing
only after(depois de) she got fired?

1410
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,081
"why didn't she complain?"

1411
00:56:25,114 --> 00:56:26,783
why didn't she complain?
really?

1412
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,451
he means
the anonymous hotline.

1413
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:29,886
both: there's a hotline?

1414
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:29,886
yeah.

1415
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,021
julia: i did
the harassment(assédio) seminar twice.

1416
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:33,122
i never(nunca) heard(ouvi) about(cerca de) a hotline.

1417
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:34,390
because it's bullshit.

1418
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:37,126
they have(ter) a contractual right
to monitor our communications.

1419
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:40,630
a hotline in this(isto) building
is like(como) a complaint box
in occupied paris.

1420
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:45,034
it's like(como) we're telling(dizendo) women,
"go on. speak(falar) up for yourself.

1421
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:48,070
"just know(conhecer) the entire network
is with(com) roger."

1422
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:49,939
no one will(vai) believe(acreditam) you.

1423
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:51,674
they'll call(chamar) you a liar.

1424
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:54,777
oh, and as for your(seu) career,
you want(querer) assignments
and air time?

1425
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,145
go ahead.
call the paranoid man

1426
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:57,713
who decides your(seu) salary
a pervert,

1427
00:56:57,746 --> 00:57:00,450
and do that(este) on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls.

1428
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,119
on a phone(telefone) he has
a contractual right(direito) to record.

1429
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:05,721
jesus fucking(porra) christ,
do you think(pensar) women(mulheres) are idiots?

1430
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:07,457
it's like
somebody stripped you naked

1431
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,858
and they(elas) want(querer) you
to walk through this(isto) office

1432
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:10,493
just to fucking(porra) prove(provar) it.

1433
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:12,095
gil: okay.

1434
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:16,132
can i see you for a minute?

1435
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,071
(door opens)

1436
00:57:25,207 --> 00:57:27,009
what the fuck(porra) was that?

1437
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:28,778
i don't know, but i liked it.

1438
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,953
i won't call(chamar) you a feminist,

1439
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,021
but say there's a spectrum,
you are...

1440
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:40,690
roger harassed me.

1441
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,694
ten years(anos) ago.

1442
00:57:46,795 --> 00:57:48,931
i had turned down
a law-firm partnership

1443
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:52,001
for an entry-level job
here at fox.

1444
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:55,772
roger would(seria) call(chamar) me up to
new york(iorque) to dangle prospects.

1445
00:57:57,706 --> 00:57:58,942
i wanted(desejado) his help.

1446
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,746
did you

1447
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,015
do anything?

1448
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,885
no. (sighs)

1449
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:10,787
will you talk?

1450
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:15,558
megyn?

1451
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:15,558
i don't know.

1452
00:58:15,591 --> 00:58:16,693
i don't know.

1453
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,531
i mean, going(vai) on the record...

1454
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:25,568
jesus.

1455
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:28,170
it's basically admitting
you're the weak one
in the herd.

1456
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:31,240
no, it's admitting
you're the hot one.

1457
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:32,909
it has nothing
to do with(com) that, gil.

1458
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,677
say women.

1459
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,677
oh, my god.

1460
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,945
look, there(lá) is a reason

1461
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:37,780
certain women
can defend roger.

1462
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,016
if i report this(isto) and it leaks,

1463
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,652
it will(vai) follow me
for the rest of my career.

1464
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,186
i don't wanna(quer) be defined
by roger's bullshit.

1465
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:47,723
i refuse to be
the fucking(porra) poster girl
for sexual harassment.

1466
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:50,693
he can't still be doing
that crap, right?

1467
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:51,728
i mean, the man has a walker.

1468
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:54,831
viagra?

1469
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:54,831
gil.

1470
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:57,267
help me here.

1471
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,303
please. how do i play this?

1472
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:05,575
well, you only(só) ask
when you already know.

1473
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:09,879
if i learned anything
this year,

1474
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:11,080
it's to not get sucked
into a fight

1475
00:59:11,113 --> 00:59:13,283
with someone
who has better(melhor) reason
to be in it than(do que) you do.

1476
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:16,185
okay.

1477
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,055
okay.

1478
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:22,692
so, what(o que) is it you wanna(quer) do?

1479
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,596
for right(direito) now, nothing.

1480
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,797
good.

1481
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:27,797
good.

1482
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,101
(sighs)

1483
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:49,785
(indistinct chatter)

1484
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:51,787
(roger groans softly)

1485
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:51,787
there she is.

1486
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,723
hi, roger.

1487
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,091
roger: hello, sweetheart.

1488
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:58,794
beth: hi.

1489
00:59:58,827 --> 00:59:59,829
sit, sit.

1490
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:04,000
roger: you've met
mayor giuliani before?

1491
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:04,000
of course.

1492
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,002
there's
an internal investigation,

1493
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,004
but i'm not gonna(vai) wait(esperar) for it
to clear(claro) me.

1494
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,740
the republican(republicano) convention
is less(menos) than(do que) two weeks away.

1495
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,109
this is bullshit.
i'm gonna(vai) fight(lutar) it.

1496
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,777
the charges are absurd.

1497
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,345
susan: i'm in, roger.

1498
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:18,981
i love(amar) that(este) fate has given me
a chance to repay you

1499
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:20,716
for when(quando) i was
in intensive care.

1500
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:24,053
roger called(chamado) my idiot doctors
every day for four(quatro) weeks.

1501
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:25,354
told them
he'd put me on the air

1502
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:26,388
live from(a partir de) the hospital bed

1503
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,291
if they(elas) didn't fix
every stitch of damage done.

1504
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:31,927
but i'm also here(aqui) as someone

1505
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,196
who has dealt with(com) this(isto) issue
for years,

1506
01:00:34,229 --> 01:00:37,667
years on the side of women.

1507
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,969
i don't wanna(quer) see
sexual violence trivialized.

1508
01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:43,939
i don't wanna(quer) see it become
some damn political football.

1509
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:47,143
in that(este) spirit, i need(necessidade) to ask,

1510
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,979
will an investigation
find anything,

1511
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:52,081
well, uncomfortable?

1512
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,086
well, define uncomfortable.

1513
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,421
rudy: roger, quote,

1514
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,022
"i think(pensar) you and i
should have(ter) had

1515
01:01:00,055 --> 01:01:02,291
"a sexual relationship
a long(grande) time(tempo) ago.

1516
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:03,859
"and then
you'd be good(boa) and better

1517
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:04,994
"and i'd be good(boa) and better."

1518
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:08,197
did you say that?

1519
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:08,197
no, i'm not a fool.

1520
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,100
"you missed your(seu) chance for me
to harass you"? come(venha) on.

1521
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:12,868
i think(pensar) they'll argue
it's solicitous.

1522
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:16,372
telling a woman(mulher) she was
fuckable "a long(grande) time(tempo) ago."

1523
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,074
who the hell thinks
that works?

1524
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,742
why's she suing, roger?

1525
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:22,344
gretchen is
a very(muito) competitive woman

1526
01:01:22,377 --> 01:01:24,280
facing a severe
likability issue.

1527
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:29,051
one that(este) i shielded her from
for years.

1528
01:01:29,084 --> 01:01:30,886
her career's over, i'm afraid.

1529
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:32,188
beth: and she can't take
a joke.

1530
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,156
roger is very(muito) salty.

1531
01:01:34,189 --> 01:01:38,060
(chuckling) i find(achar) it amusing.
it's my fault. i encourage it.

1532
01:01:38,093 --> 01:01:41,263
james murdoch
could be behind(atrás) this.

1533
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:43,432
his wife
openly supports hillary.

1534
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:45,334
and it could(poderia) go deeper.

1535
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:47,236
i have(ter) good(boa) reason(razão) to believe

1536
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:49,371
that inside
the obama white(branco) house,

1537
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:50,740
there have(ter) been(estive) discussions,

1538
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,742
on what(o que) level i do not know...

1539
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,478
of having me killed.

1540
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,021
(cell phone(telefone) buzzing)

1541
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:25,407
(beeps)

1542
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:25,407
(buzzer sounds)

1543
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,176
(reporters
speaking indistinctly)

1544
01:02:33,482 --> 01:02:34,984
(cell phone(telefone) buzzing)

1545
01:02:46,461 --> 01:02:47,764
(softly) oh, jesus.

1546
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:52,068
hi, there.

1547
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:52,068
hey.

1548
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,338
roger needs(precisa) you.

1549
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,974
your silence is being(sendo) noticed.

1550
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:02,144
well, the whole point
of an investigation

1551
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:03,879
is to find(achar) the truth, jeanine.

1552
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:05,981
until that(este) happens,
i don't have(ter) a lot to say.

1553
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:08,250
jeanine:
if this(isto) charge sticks,

1554
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:09,885
the working assumption
will be,

1555
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:12,922
"every woman(mulher) at fox got down
on her knees."

1556
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:15,457
even you.

1557
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,459
if we sweep this(isto) thing
under the rug, jeanine,

1558
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:19,094
and it happens(acontece) again,

1559
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:20,596
under title seven,

1560
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:21,897
fox will(vai) be liable

1561
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,333
for compensatory
and punitive damages.

1562
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:26,001
that could(poderia) be
hundreds of millions.

1563
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:28,404
let's worry about(cerca de) the law
before we do the pr, okay?

1564
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:31,240
does roger want(querer) us?

1565
01:03:31,273 --> 01:03:34,043
yes. he's a man.

1566
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,512
he also gave(deu) us time.

1567
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:38,480
he gave(deu) us opportunity.

1568
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:40,516
we benefited
from that(este) kind of attention.

1569
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:45,888
i mean, jeanine pirro?

1570
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,624
she's the founding member
of team(equipe) roger.

1571
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:49,892
you're not answering
your phone.

1572
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:51,160
no, i'm holding it.

1573
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:53,028
okay, well, everybody's
still looking(olhando) for you.

1574
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:56,465
where were(eram) any of these(esses) people
to defend me from(a partir de) trump, hmm?

1575
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:56,465
excuse me.

1576
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:57,867
bill shine(brilhar) told(contado) them(eles) not to.

1577
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,935
what the fuck?

1578
01:03:59,968 --> 01:04:01,604
our boss.

1579
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,339
why are you guys(pessoal) in the hall?

1580
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,974
i got a call
from roger's lawyer

1581
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,142
saying to, quote, "relax."

1582
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:09,211
they're convincing rupert
to limit the investigation

1583
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:10,646
to gretchen and her team.

1584
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:12,948
that's only(só) five or six women.

1585
01:04:12,981 --> 01:04:14,383
are you gonna(vai) let that(este) happen?

1586
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:20,256
(horns honking)

1587
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:25,027
i like(como) roger. i do.

1588
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:25,995
i know.

1589
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,664
even if he can be controlling
and vindictive.

1590
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:31,367
those sins aren't really
the problem, meg.

1591
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,402
i mean, there(lá) were
hundreds of stories

1592
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:35,170
of roger paying
an employee's rehab,

1593
01:04:35,203 --> 01:04:37,640
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll.

1594
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:40,342
you remember
when shep came(veio) out.

1595
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,610
all roger said(disse) was,

1596
01:04:41,643 --> 01:04:42,711
"i don't care
where you put your(seu) pecker,

1597
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:44,947
"as long(grande) as you don't tell(dizer) me
where to put mine."

1598
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,549
again, not the most(a maioria) redeeming.

1599
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:51,086
he promoted me,
he looked past the rejection,

1600
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,189
he looked past the risk
of this(isto) exact conversation.

1601
01:04:54,222 --> 01:04:56,225
he handed me the power
to hurt him.

1602
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:20,449
(seagulls calling)

1603
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,654
(line ringing)

1604
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:28,123
morning.

1605
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:28,123
lachlan: hi, megyn.

1606
01:05:28,156 --> 01:05:31,260
we need(necessidade) to get
gerson zweifach on the phone.

1607
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:33,262
rudy:
gerson, i'm calling(chamando) for roger.

1608
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:35,264
he wants(quer) me to be
part of your(seu) investigation.

1609
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:37,066
we've decided
on an outside firm.

1610
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,569
no, why? gerson, we can
handle this(isto) ourselves.

1611
01:05:40,602 --> 01:05:42,204
i'm asking paul/weiss.

1612
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:43,238
paul/weiss?

1613
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,342
you tell(dizer) them(eles) that
i can actively participate.

1614
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,378
mr. giuliani,
you're an old friend of roger.

1615
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:50,512
you married them.

1616
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:52,348
sharing information with(com) you

1617
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:54,350
will remove the cloak
of attorney-client privilege,

1618
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,318
making the testimony
of any woman

1619
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:58,620
who comes forward
subject to discovery.

1620
01:05:58,653 --> 01:06:01,190
i understand.
you get me a waiver.

1621
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:02,524
i will(vai) not structure
this investigation

1622
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:05,260
so roger isn't perceived of
as its target.

1623
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:07,496
you want(querer) him to look(olhar) guilty?

1624
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:09,198
well, that(este) depends
on what(o que) we find.

1625
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:11,500
(sighs)

1626
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,170
you know(conhecer) a reporter,
gabe sherman?

1627
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,306
no.

1628
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,306
you're about(cerca de) to.

1629
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:18,507
he's found six women

1630
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,376
who claim roger ailes
harassed them.

1631
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:23,112
all from(a partir de) before(antes de) roger
founded fox news.

1632
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,016
marsha: this(isto) was years(anos) ago.

1633
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,717
he said(disse) he would
put me on the show,

1634
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,486
but i had to go to bed
with him.

1635
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,689
and i just(somente) said, "yeah, right.
you and who else?"

1636
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:35,424
and he said, "just me

1637
01:06:35,457 --> 01:06:37,994
"and a few of
my preferred friends."

1638
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:42,197
diane: i came(veio) in
and he closed the door,

1639
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:43,532
turned, and kissed me.

1640
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:45,267
like i was his girlfriend.

1641
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,702
like he knew(sabia) it was coming.

1642
01:06:46,735 --> 01:06:48,604
he grabbed my tits
and he said,

1643
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:52,074
"look, no girl(menina) gets(fica) a job here
unless they're cooperative."

1644
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:54,810
pat:
in new york(iorque) city

1645
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:54,810
"if you wanna(quer) make(fazer) it

1646
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:56,211
"in the tv business,

1647
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:57,613
"you're gonna(vai) have(ter) to fuck(porra) me.

1648
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:58,814
"and you're gonna(vai) have(ter) to
do that

1649
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,416
"with anyone(alguém) i tell(dizer) you to."

1650
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:02,751
jane: he finishes the test,

1651
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:04,753
which is me
pretending to cook,

1652
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:07,122
then he pulls out
a garter belt and stockings

1653
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:08,724
and says, "put these(esses) on."

1654
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:11,794
so, yeah, well, i put them(eles) on.

1655
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,363
kellie: and he said,

1656
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:15,764
"you know,
i can really(verdade) help(ajuda) you,

1657
01:07:15,797 --> 01:07:17,733
"but if you wanna(quer) play
with the big boys,

1658
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:20,069
"you have(ter) to lay
with the big boys."

1659
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,071
it was very(muito) transactional.

1660
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:26,809
susan: it was quiet.
he stared at me.

1661
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,178
he undid his pants

1662
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:33,215
and took(tomou) out his penis
very gingerly.

1663
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:35,517
(stammers)
i had never(nunca) seen(visto) one.

1664
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,586
i was scared.

1665
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,689
then he said, "kiss it."

1666
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:42,324
i was 16.

1667
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,628
reporter: former anchor
gretchen carlson

1668
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:48,530
filing a sexual-harassment
lawsuit

1669
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:50,666
against fox news
chief roger ailes.

1670
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,301
more women(mulheres) are coming(chegando) forward.

1671
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,602
ailes is denying
the allegations

1672
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:55,137
and getting
some high-profile support...

1673
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:57,306
reporter 2: the accusations
against roger ailes
are growing...

1674
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,341
roger: i have(ter) never(nunca) run
a goddamn(maldito) dairy queen.

1675
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:02,478
you don't get to go
and get whatever you want.

1676
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,647
everybody on my shows
knows the meaning of decency,

1677
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,883
and i do mean(significar) everybody.

1678
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:11,386
a tv outfit needs(precisa) tough,
confident women.

1679
01:08:11,419 --> 01:08:13,789
do i push them?
you bet your(seu) ass i do.

1680
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:17,259
but have(ter) i ever(sempre) demanded sex
during a casting session?

1681
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:20,295
have i offered extra pay
for blowjobs?

1682
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:23,899
give me a goddamn(maldito) break!
why the hell would(seria) i do that?

1683
01:08:23,932 --> 01:08:26,735
you know(conhecer) the look(olhar) in a woman's
eye when(quando) she's interested.

1684
01:08:26,768 --> 01:08:30,205
walk into(em) casting
back then(então) as the decider.

1685
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,142
there was a look
they gave. (sighs)

1686
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,477
i did not always
look like(como) this.

1687
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:36,845
i never(nunca) had to harass anybody

1688
01:08:36,878 --> 01:08:39,481
and it's fucking(porra) offensive
to say that(este) i did!

1689
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:41,450
beth: well, they're trying
to change(mudança) history.

1690
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:44,687
for their(deles) families.
some of them(eles) probably don't
even remember what(o que) happened.

1691
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,823
that's gracious of you, beth.

1692
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:52,761
but this(isto) is political.

1693
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:56,231
i defy you
to find(achar) any evidence

1694
01:08:56,264 --> 01:08:59,368
that a single part(papel) of what
these women(mulheres) are saying(dizendo) is true.

1695
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:01,537
get ready. more(mais) will(vai) come.

1696
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,306
we need(necessidade) to let rupert know
what it means(significa) if i lose.

1697
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:07,442
gretchen carlson
could kill fox news.

1698
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,678
this is a fight(lutar) for your(seu) jobs.

1699
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,480
if i go, you go!

1700
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:14,449
(breathing heavily)

1701
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:17,319
if you'd asked(perguntou) me what(o que) type of
sexual fetish roger ailes had,

1702
01:09:17,352 --> 01:09:18,654
i never(nunca) would(seria) have(ter) come(venha) up
with garter belts,

1703
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,222
but it's fucking(porra) perfect.

1704
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,191
their stories are so similar.

1705
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,225
megyn:
that doesn't prove(provar) much.

1706
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,427
sherman met them(eles) all
through gretchen's lawyer.

1707
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,462
they could(poderia) have(ter) been(estive) coached.

1708
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,498
the blowjob thing
feels real to me.

1709
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:31,667
does roger seem like(como) a guy
who would(seria) get off

1710
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,869
on that(este) particular
power dynamic? yes.

1711
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:35,470
a guy who maybe thinks

1712
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:37,906
oral doesn't
really count? maybe.

1713
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,641
a guy who has
reasons to prefer

1714
01:09:39,674 --> 01:09:41,844
a sex act that(este) lets him
keep his clothes on?

1715
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:43,912
sure.

1716
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:45,281
still doesn't make(fazer) it true.

1717
01:09:46,514 --> 01:09:47,849
gil: well, if true,

1718
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:50,819
these incidents all happened
before fox started.

1719
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,655
should that(este) matter?

1720
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,655
no.

1721
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:54,690
yes.

1722
01:09:56,424 --> 01:09:57,493
(megyn sighs)

1723
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:02,898
i talked to gerson zweifach.

1724
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,000
and?

1725
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:06,635
he asked(perguntou) me to encourage women

1726
01:10:06,668 --> 01:10:08,136
who have(ter) claims
to come(venha) forward.

1727
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,473
you remember what(o que) happened
last time(tempo) you got
between rupert and roger?

1728
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,811
before i speak(falar) out,

1729
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,681
i need(necessidade) to know
if this(isto) happened
to other(de outros) women(mulheres) at fox.

1730
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:21,984
you understand that?

1731
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:26,455
is this(isto) one
where you really(verdade) wanna(quer) know,

1732
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:28,657
or you wanna(quer) look(olhar) like

1733
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,259
you really(verdade) wanna(quer) know,
but don't?

1734
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,495
i really(verdade) wanna(quer) know.

1735
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:38,000
i'm not always(sempre) like(como) that.

1736
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:40,969
irena:
no one around here(aqui) believes

1737
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:43,272
roger would(seria) want
to harass gretchen.

1738
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:46,742
i will(vai) send you some(alguns) of
her soapy notes to roger.

1739
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,011
"last night
sandra filled in for megyn.

1740
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,979
"why not me? smiley face."

1741
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:54,416
who sends a harasser
a smiley face?

1742
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:56,018
nancy: martin.

1743
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:56,018
hey, nancy.

1744
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:57,853
thanks for coming.

1745
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:57,853
of course.

1746
01:10:58,486 --> 01:11:00,656
gretchen: hi, nancy. coffee?

1747
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,258
nancy: thank(obrigado) you. (sighs)

1748
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,761
so, what(o que) do you got?

1749
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:11,667
so, um, no one from(a partir de) fox
has come(venha) forward.

1750
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,035
no one?

1751
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,336
nancy: rudi bakhtiar.

1752
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,573
but no one who's still there?

1753
01:11:18,606 --> 01:11:21,310
there's been(estive) nothing
but praise for roger.

1754
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,512
except from(a partir de) megyn kelly.

1755
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,680
she's been(estive) unusually silent.

1756
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,548
right. well,
something must've happened

1757
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,483
to megyn in the past
with roger.

1758
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,053
she's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1759
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,421
martin: possibly.

1760
01:11:33,388 --> 01:11:34,790
should you call?

1761
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,826
tell her this(isto) is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1762
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:39,828
megyn, share?

1763
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:41,797
no. she wouldn't do it.

1764
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,598
what makes you say that?

1765
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,598
because i wouldn't.

1766
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:46,668
i mean, roger plays his women
off against(contra) each other.

1767
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:47,969
he's always(sempre) done(feito) it.
he'll say,

1768
01:11:48,002 --> 01:11:49,938
"megyn thinks that
lisa should(devemos) get your(seu) spot."

1769
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:52,441
or, "megyn suspects
that you're screwing cal."

1770
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,076
and then(então) he'll offer advice
on how to get back(de volta) at her,

1771
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,310
as if you brought it up.

1772
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,913
martin:
she's renegotiating her deal.
i can think(pensar) of roughly

1773
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,615
15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

1774
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:02,684
we do need(necessidade) some(alguns) collaboration.

1775
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:03,885
martin: well,
that would(seria) certainly help

1776
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:05,587
with the other(de outros) networks.

1777
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,456
oh, god. what?

1778
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:09,558
what, marty?

1779
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,927
well, we've not had, um,

1780
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,730
a lot of incoming
job interests from(a partir de) them.

1781
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,398
(chuckles)

1782
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:17,599
what's not a lot?

1783
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:20,903
none.

1784
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:23,339
they're afraid of roger.

1785
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:25,974
no.

1786
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:28,110
no woman(mulher) gets(fica) to sue her boss.

1787
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,078
rule number one
of corporate america,

1788
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:31,547
you don't sue your(seu) boss.

1789
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:36,051
(sighs) i jumped off a cliff.

1790
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,857
i thought one of them
would stand with(com) me.

1791
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,025
(door opens)

1792
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,094
(children giggling)

1793
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:47,763
hey, mom.

1794
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:47,763
hey, we're home.

1795
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:50,031
gretchen: (softly)
god, uh... hey, honey.

1796
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:51,933
there's a snack
in the kitchen.

1797
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:53,135
okay.

1798
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:53,135
thanks.

1799
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:54,903
(sniffles)

1800
01:12:56,504 --> 01:12:58,440
(martin sighs(suspira) deeply)

1801
01:12:58,473 --> 01:12:59,541
we're gonna(vai) get him.

1802
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:03,912
gil: megyn doesn't want
to release a statement.

1803
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:06,148
it could(poderia) be seen(visto) as
influencing the investigation.

1804
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:08,984
have her say that
to roger's face.

1805
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,621
look, let us know(conhecer) who else
hasn't spoken up for him,

1806
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:16,024
and maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

1807
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:19,094
no! jesus. we need
our anchors. we need(necessidade) her.

1808
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:21,530
let me talk(conversa) to her.

1809
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,131
yes, please.

1810
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,131
(door opens)

1811
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:28,136
look, sweetheart. this(isto) is
an island of safety and truth.

1812
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:29,905
martha: i wear(vestem) pants.

1813
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,174
no one has ever(sempre) told(contado) me
not to wear(vestem) pants.

1814
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,076
i wear(vestem) pants. i'd love(amar) to know
where that(este) came(veio) from.

1815
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:36,645
jeanine:
it's obnoxious. it's toxic.

1816
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,748
we need(necessidade) everyone
on team(equipe) roger.

1817
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:41,550
everyone.

1818
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,085
hi.

1819
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,085
jeanine: good(boa) morning.

1820
01:13:44,786 --> 01:13:49,191
come on. no one
makes me wear(vestem) short skirts.

1821
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,759
(indistinct chatter)

1822
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:54,830
he was the first
to put a female on

1823
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,598
as host(hospedeiro) of a prime-time show.

1824
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:58,667
roger ailes champions women.

1825
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,570
no. there(lá) is no leg cam.

1826
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,539
no. could(poderia) you just
hold on for one sec?

1827
01:14:04,572 --> 01:14:06,608
maggie? i have(ter) to
wear pants(calça) tomorrow.

1828
01:14:06,641 --> 01:14:09,177
not without(sem) authorization from
the second(segundo) floor, you don't.

1829
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,946
wardrobe assistant:
we never(nunca) fitted her for pants!

1830
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,180
you can print
whatever story(história) you like,

1831
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:13,248
but there(lá) is no leg cam.

1832
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:14,649
lily?

1833
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:14,649
hmm?

1834
01:14:14,682 --> 01:14:16,618
beth needs(precisa) me
to talk(conversa) to megyn.

1835
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:18,019
i'm gonna(vai) do
an on-air statement

1836
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:19,154
while all the fox women
come out

1837
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:20,789
one by one behind(atrás) me
for roger.

1838
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:22,491
that will(vai) never(nunca) happen.

1839
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:24,993
ains?

1840
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:31,900
(eddy chuckles)

1841
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:34,836
well, you know(conhecer) why roger's got
that door(porta) blocking his office?

1842
01:14:34,869 --> 01:14:37,138
well, yeah, 'cause
a bangladeshi from(a partir de) accounting

1843
01:14:37,171 --> 01:14:38,840
wandered in one day
by mistake.

1844
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:40,208
(chuckles) please.

1845
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:41,176
it's so girls can come(venha) in

1846
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:42,878
from the back(de volta) elevator
and no one sees 'em.

1847
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,481
really?

1848
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,481
mmm-hmm.

1849
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,883
mercede: we get talent
coming here(aqui) all the time

1850
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,651
looking to get
their faces done.

1851
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:52,020
"i'm going(vai) to see roger.
i gotta(preciso) look(olhar) my best."

1852
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:53,088
yeah. one came(veio) back(de volta) out

1853
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,524
with it rubbed off her nose
and chin. (chuckles)

1854
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:57,993
who was that?

1855
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:04,232
(chuckles)
my memory's horrible.

1856
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:06,268
you should(devemos) go see janice
in weather.

1857
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:11,039
i mean, nobody(ninguém) wants(quer) to talk.

1858
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:13,842
can you blame them?

1859
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:13,842
(sighs) no.

1860
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,244
gil: where'd you disappear to?

1861
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:18,647
i've got names.

1862
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,116
women rumored
to have(ter) stories about(cerca de) roger.

1863
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:22,751
from who?

1864
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:22,751
janice.

1865
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,620
weather janice?

1866
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,620
everybody confides in her.

1867
01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:27,222
nobody from(a partir de) weather
wants your(seu) job.

1868
01:15:27,255 --> 01:15:28,290
what are you going
to do with(com) them?

1869
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:29,824
tell them
this time's different.

1870
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:30,959
wait.

1871
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:30,959
lily: no, don't wait.

1872
01:15:30,992 --> 01:15:31,893
don't listen(ouvir) to him.

1873
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:34,629
listen... look, it's not only
your job here.

1874
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:37,666
i got kids, okay?
lily has a baby now.

1875
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,268
julia'll lose her visa
and have(ter) to go back(de volta) to canada.

1876
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:44,039
and we know(conhecer) that(este) you've been
talking to broadcast networks.

1877
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:47,642
yeah, you can get a job
anywhere. but we can't.

1878
01:15:47,675 --> 01:15:50,078
and no offense,
but who the hell will(vai) you be?

1879
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:54,316
nobody leaves fox, megyn.
not really.

1880
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,851
it's in your(seu) dna now.

1881
01:15:56,884 --> 01:16:00,255
so, think(pensar) about
what you're blowing up here.

1882
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:02,057
i say find(achar) the truth.

1883
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,801
well, that(este) face
tells me nothing.

1884
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:15,203
well, if they(elas) come(venha) after(depois de) you,

1885
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:17,706
it won't be you
they come(venha) after.

1886
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,182
seth meyers: (on tv)
gretchen carlson,

1887
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,717
your old colleague
at fox news,

1888
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,884
has issued some(alguns) allegations,

1889
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,620
some sexual-harassment
allegations

1890
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,154
over your(seu) boss, roger ailes.

1891
01:16:33,187 --> 01:16:34,656
what is your(seu) position on this?

1892
01:16:34,689 --> 01:16:35,957
what did you think
when you heard(ouvi) this?

1893
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,059
o'reilly: in this(isto) country,
every famous,

1894
01:16:38,092 --> 01:16:40,929
powerful or wealthy person
is a target.

1895
01:16:40,962 --> 01:16:42,664
you're a target. i'm a target.

1896
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:45,700
any time,
somebody could(poderia) come(venha) out

1897
01:16:45,733 --> 01:16:47,302
and sue us, attack us,

1898
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:48,903
go to the press
or anything(nada) like(como) that.

1899
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:50,739
and that's
a deplorable situation.

1900
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,941
i've worked for roger ailes
for 20 years.

1901
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:54,676
best boss(patrão) i've ever(sempre) had.

1902
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:56,778
well, i've never(nunca) been(estive) told
what i can't wear.

1903
01:16:57,712 --> 01:16:59,080
well, i know(conhecer) you didn't ask,

1904
01:16:59,113 --> 01:17:00,782
but i think
it needs(precisa) to be said.

1905
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,086
it's a very(muito) confusing time
right now.

1906
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:06,855
tonight is manhattanhenge.

1907
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:09,391
sunset will(vai) align perfectly
with the city's grid.

1908
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:13,261
the best viewing streets
are 14th, 34th and 57th.

1909
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:15,130
good day, new york.

1910
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:15,130
floor director: and clear.

1911
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:16,197
juliet: see you tomorrow,
jimmy.

1912
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,465
jimmy: yep. have(ter) a good(boa) one.

1913
01:17:17,498 --> 01:17:21,136
megyn : a babe with(com) no geezer?
this can't be a fox affiliate.

1914
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,239
megyn. my god. how are you?

1915
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,239
(laughs)

1916
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,840

1917
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:27,742
good. how's your(seu) mom?

1918
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:30,178
she's good. she's training
to be a security(segurança) guard.

1919
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:32,347
is that(este) because(porque) of
the trump(trunfo) stuff, or is that...

1920
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:35,083
no. she just(somente) wants(quer) a job
where she gets(fica) to carry a gun.

1921
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:37,218
(laughs)

1922
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:43,825
so, did you come(venha) up here
to talk(conversa) about(cerca de) roger?

1923
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:45,760
what would(seria) make(fazer) you
say that? (sighs)

1924
01:17:45,793 --> 01:17:47,195
i've been(estive) at local
for two years,

1925
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:48,764
nobody's ever(sempre) come(venha) to see me.

1926
01:17:49,797 --> 01:17:50,899
you miss(perder) us?

1927
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:54,269
the network(rede) i worked at
for 14 years?

1928
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:57,339
that my dad helped build?
where my brother's a reporter?

1929
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,409
juliet, did roger ever...

1930
01:18:01,442 --> 01:18:03,378
no.

1931
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,847
i heard(ouvi) things,
but nothing(nada) firsthand.

1932
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:07,416
good.

1933
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:10,318
i miss(perder) you.

1934
01:18:08,516 --> 01:18:10,318
i miss(perder) you more.

1935
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:12,854
we should(devemos) go have(ter) a drink.

1936
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:12,854
yes.

1937
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:15,724
um... (clicks tongue)

1938
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:23,799
roger...

1939
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:25,701
(sighs)

1940
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:30,905
he has detectives on staff.

1941
01:18:30,938 --> 01:18:32,307
up on 14.

1942
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,044
they look(olhar) into(em) enemies,
follow them,

1943
01:18:36,077 --> 01:18:37,912
post negative stories online.

1944
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:39,280
it's called(chamado) the black room.

1945
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:40,849
i don't want(querer) you
in danger, all right?

1946
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,051
(softly) no, no, no.
i'm not talking(conversando) about(cerca de) me.

1947
01:18:45,052 --> 01:18:46,354
i'm talking(conversando) about(cerca de) you.

1948
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:51,393
be careful who you ask
questions about(cerca de) roger ailes.

1949
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:59,501
my lawyers
are negotiating with(com) fox.

1950
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,306
not that(este) bill(projeto de lei) will(vai) pay
any of it.

1951
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:06,040
bill?

1952
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:07,242

(sniffles)

1956
01:19:15,483 --> 01:19:16,485
sorry.

1957
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,522
fish rots from(a partir de) the head.
(chuckles)

1960
01:19:30,898 --> 01:19:33,401

some issues over(sobre) here.

1961
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:34,936
i did.

1962
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:36,438
if you have(ter) a name to give.

1963
01:19:37,905 --> 01:19:39,841
roger.

1964
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:41,943
i wouldn't ask
if i didn't think(pensar) it was safe.

1965
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:43,845
(men laughing)

1966
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:49,050

1978
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,312
mmm-hmm.

1979
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:18,580
did you learn a lot from(a partir de) her?

1980
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,448
kayla: i did, yes.

1981
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:23,218
i have(ter) nothing(nada) but
good things(coisas) to say about(cerca de) her.

1982
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,253
that's great.

1983
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,188
you know, i always(sempre) find(achar) it
so interesting

1984
01:20:27,221 --> 01:20:28,323
who history chooses

1985
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,425
to do something(alguma coisa) important.

1986
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,425
mmm.

1987
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,262

1988
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:36,031
listen, i wanted(desejado) to ask you...

1989
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,137
i wanted(desejado) to ask you
if roger is harassing you.

1990
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:51,880
how did you know?

1991
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,018
we find(achar) each other.

1992
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,389
you, too?

1993
01:21:02,523 --> 01:21:03,925
long time(tempo) ago.

1994
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:08,930
wow. (sighs)

1995
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:18,139

1996
01:21:19,273 --> 01:21:20,408
mmm-hmm.

1997
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,149
you should(devemos) report roger.

1998
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,318
you'll be protected.

1999
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:31,953
did you?

2000
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,389
i took(tomou) it to his superior.

2001
01:21:37,258 --> 01:21:40,228
nothing happened.
i had to drop it.

2002
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:41,263
why?

2003
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,367
i wanted(desejado) to be on television.

2004
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:50,038
did you think
what your(seu) silence would(seria) mean?

2005
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:54,242
for us? the rest of us?

2006
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:56,511
roger is not my fault.
(chuckles)

2007
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,714
it would've been(estive) nice if...

2008
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:03,952
if somebody(alguém) told(contado) us that
he's after(depois de) more(mais) than(do que) legs.

2009
01:22:05,486 --> 01:22:08,089
it's nobody's job
to protect you, kayla.

by old rules?

2017
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:27,976

2018
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,348
so, you had sex with(com) him?

2019
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,417

2051
01:24:01,702 --> 01:24:04,672
and make(fazer) it go away, you know?

2052
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:15,083
i think(pensar) i'm...

2053
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,520
i think(pensar) i'm gonna

01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,223

2056
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,693
(stammers) i'm really(verdade) glad

2057
01:24:25,726 --> 01:24:28,663
i think(pensar) that's absolutely
what you should(devemos) do.

2058
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:29,831

2059
01:24:31,165 --> 01:24:33,301

2061
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,138
i can't call(chamar) anyone(alguém) else
and i just...

2062
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:39,240
i need(necessidade) someone(alguém) right(direito) now

2063
01:24:39,273 --> 01:24:42,410
to tell(dizer) me
that that's what(o que) i should(devemos) do.

2064
01:24:42,443 --> 01:24:43,578
oh, my god, yes.

2065
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,213
i heard(ouvi) it was, like,
an outside firm

2066
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,182
and they're taking it
really seriously.

2067
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,385
okay, great. thanks.

2068
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:54,689
kayla.

2069
01:24:55,322 --> 01:24:56,624
(sniffles)

2070
01:24:56,657 --> 01:24:58,259
what happened?

2071
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:02,630
i did it.

2072
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,266
(sobs) i...

2073
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:08,436
i did it. i gave(deu) in to him.

2074
01:25:10,404 --> 01:25:11,673
(sniffles)

2075
01:25:12,606 --> 01:25:14,142
kayla, i...

2076
01:25:15,809 --> 01:25:17,345
i'm so sorry.

2077
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:21,382
(sniffles) he kept talking.
he just(somente) kept talking.

2078
01:25:21,415 --> 01:25:22,784
he kept saying...

2079
01:25:24,218 --> 01:25:26,220
"good girl.

2080
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:28,423
"that's a good(boa) girl.
be a good(boa) soldier.

2081
01:25:31,258 --> 01:25:32,827
"earn your(seu) place."

2082
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,328
fuck.

2083
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:36,631
he didn't even... (sniffles)

2084
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:37,899
didn't even(até) unbuckle.

2085
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:40,768
he couldn't get...

2086
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:42,470
(sighs deeply)

2087
01:25:49,977 --> 01:25:51,612
(sniffles)

2088
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:53,714
(sobbing) i feel(sentir) so filthy.

2089
01:25:53,747 --> 01:25:55,483
no, kayla.

2090
01:25:55,516 --> 01:25:57,552
you didn't do anything(nada) wrong.

2091
01:26:00,721 --> 01:26:01,890
i'm sorry.

2092
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:06,828
i better(melhor) go.

2093
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:11,699
megyn: roger can sense
vulnerabilities.

2094
01:26:11,732 --> 01:26:15,203
in those(essa) days, our meetings
were career-strategy sessions

2095
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:18,773
mixed with(com) good(boa) advice
and comments like...

2096
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:22,443
the most(a maioria) basic thing
is confidence.

2097
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:24,712
feel at home(casa) in your(seu) own skin.

2098
01:26:24,745 --> 01:26:27,248
if you're confident,
you're sexy.

2099
01:26:27,281 --> 01:26:29,617
i'm sure(claro) you have
some sexy bras.

2100
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:32,453
i'd love(amar) to see you in those.
(chuckles)

2101
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:36,991
it was a cat-and-mouse game.

2102
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:39,360
but he always(sempre) gave(deu) me
good advice,

2103
01:26:39,393 --> 01:26:40,695
and let me deflect,

2104
01:26:42,663 --> 01:26:44,199
tell him to dream on.

2105
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:48,436
the more(mais) i let him
get away(longe) with,

2106
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:52,807
the more(mais) he pushed my buttons.

2107
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,477
roger: i don't know(conhecer) if women
can be good(boa) interviewers.

2108
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:59,714
men have(ter) that(este) killer instinct.

2109
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:03,384
we do bad things.

2110
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:03,384
(scoffs)

2111
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,353
and we do not
feel guilty about(cerca de) it.

2112
01:27:07,688 --> 01:27:11,492
how can i be sure
you have(ter) that(este) kind of drive?

2113
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:17,732
finally, in january...

2114
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:18,933
this is '06?

2115
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:20,235
yes.

2116
01:27:31,945 --> 01:27:33,548
(inaudible)

2117
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,026
(megyn grunts)

2118
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,528
he grabbed me.

2119
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:51,432
tried to kiss me.

2120
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,776
i pushed him away(longe) twice.

2121
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,752
as i was leaving, he asked,
"when's your(seu) contract up?"

2122
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:29,837
after the third time, i left.

2123
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,807
and he never(nunca) tried
anything again?

2124
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,042
no.

2125
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:37,612
i ignored his calls.
stayed in dc.

2126
01:28:38,312 --> 01:28:39,847
two years(anos) later, i had a show.

2127
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:44,118
any long-term consequences?

2128
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:45,486
(chuckles)

2129
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:47,655
(clicks tongue)

2130
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:49,624
yeah. um...

2131
01:28:57,998 --> 01:29:00,134
am i witness w?

2132
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:02,537
yes. why?

2133
01:29:03,637 --> 01:29:05,606
it's the 23rd letter
in the alphabet.

2134
01:29:06,673 --> 01:29:08,442
have 22 other(de outros) women
come forward

2135
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:10,011
since i first(primeiro) spoke to you?

2136
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:12,780
have they?

2137
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:18,419
will there(lá) be more?

2138
01:29:28,128 --> 01:29:29,964
reporter: a major bombshell
this morning.

2139
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,867
star anchor(âncora) megyn kelly
has informed lawyers

2140
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,769
that fox news(notícias) ceo,
roger ailes,

2141
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,504
sexually harassed her.

2142
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:37,872
for her to level
these allegations

2143
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:39,407
is devastating against(contra) ailes.

2144
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,776
we are seeing
the end of an era at fox news.

2145
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:43,611
the dagger in his heart,
in some(alguns) ways,

2146
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,179
was the notion
that megyn kelly

2147
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:47,181
was among his accusers.

2148
01:29:47,214 --> 01:29:48,883
what?

2149
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,452
what? (sighs)

2150
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,121
yes. yes.

2151
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,424
(panting)

2152
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:01,095
(indistinct chatter)

2153
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,765
roger, what's the matter?

2154
01:30:04,798 --> 01:30:06,033
megyn's claiming
i harassed her.

2155
01:30:06,066 --> 01:30:07,768
what?

2156
01:30:06,066 --> 01:30:07,768
you saw gabe sherman's post?

2157
01:30:07,801 --> 01:30:09,804
roger: james has been
feeding him bullshit.

2158
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:10,938
comb through megyn's press.

2159
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:10,938
(door closes)

2160
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:13,641
find every(todo) single positive
thing she's said(disse) about(cerca de) me

2161
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:14,975
and get it out, now.

2162
01:30:15,008 --> 01:30:18,446
roger, i can't discredit
an anchor(âncora) i'm paid to promote.

2163
01:30:20,614 --> 01:30:23,017
glad i'm not in a foxhole
with you.

2164
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:26,053
well, we'll leak something
to breitbart or to drudge.

2165
01:30:26,086 --> 01:30:27,455
i'm sorry, roger.

2166
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,123
(loudly) well, do something!

2167
01:30:29,156 --> 01:30:31,559
at least get some(alguns) shit
about gretchen out there.

2168
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,494
these women
are trying to fuck(porra) me!

2169
01:30:37,664 --> 01:30:39,633
i have(ter) no answers for you
that you don't already know.

2170
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:41,101
it's out of my hands
at this(isto) point.

2171
01:30:41,134 --> 01:30:43,804
we will(vai) be emailing you guys.
please just(somente) hold tight.

2172
01:30:43,837 --> 01:30:45,540
(indistinct chatter)

2173
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,642
thanks.

2174
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:49,210
greta: hey, gil.

2175
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:50,578
hey, greta.

2176
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,713
what's megyn's endgame?

2177
01:30:52,746 --> 01:30:54,915
this part(papel) of her
contract negotiation?

2178
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:56,584
it's not economic.

2179
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:56,584
(scoffs)

2180
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,052
or political.

2181
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:59,086
okay, gil.

2182
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:04,658
ainsley:
no, this(isto) is scaring me.

2183
01:31:04,691 --> 01:31:05,960
it's like
the whole world's on fire

2184
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:07,895
and no one can be trusted.

2185
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:07,895
assistant: hey, geraldo.

2186
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:09,797
cnn, line(linha) six.

2187
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:09,797
can't talk.

2188
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,532
these are the end-times.

2189
01:31:11,565 --> 01:31:12,600
why aren't you on the phone?

2190
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,101
to comment
on sexual harassment?

2191
01:31:14,134 --> 01:31:15,803
we work(trabalhos) for bill.

2192
01:31:15,836 --> 01:31:16,971
team roger.

2193
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,572
hey, we need(necessidade) you to wear(vestem) it.

2194
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:19,773
no.

2195
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:19,773
are you kidding?

2196
01:31:19,806 --> 01:31:20,941
no.

2197
01:31:19,806 --> 01:31:20,941
are you kidding?

2198
01:31:20,974 --> 01:31:22,209
man: doesn't she have(ter) a job?

2199
01:31:20,974 --> 01:31:22,209
get it on.

2200
01:31:22,242 --> 01:31:23,711
megyn kelly has no comment.

2201
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,879
she's traveling.

2202
01:31:25,812 --> 01:31:27,047
to cleveland.

2203
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,683
for the republican(republicano) convention,
remember?

2204
01:31:29,716 --> 01:31:31,585
look, i've known him
for 40 years,

2205
01:31:31,618 --> 01:31:33,988
and he's about(cerca de) as flirty as
the grizzly from(a partir de) the revenant.

2206
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,122
neil: let me
tell you something.

2207
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,992
i called(chamado) these(esses) allegations
sick 'cause they(elas) are sick.

2208
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,561
hey, why wasn't i let in
on the pact?

2209
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:41,629
what pact?

2210
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,097
breitbart is saying
there's a pact

2211
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,099
among our
top 50 on-air talents

2212
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:46,534
that if roger gets(fica) fired,
we all walk.

2213
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:47,701
great. where(onde) do i sign?

2214
01:31:47,734 --> 01:31:48,969
wait, i never(nunca) heard(ouvi) of a pact.

2215
01:31:49,002 --> 01:31:50,004
me either.

2216
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:53,808
roger placed it.

2217
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:56,777
fake news.

2218
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,845
come on.

2219
01:31:57,878 --> 01:31:59,780
gretchen: how bad
does it look(olhar) for roger?

2220
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:02,216
nancy: bad.

2221
01:32:02,249 --> 01:32:05,219
doesn't feel
like i imagined it would.

2222
01:32:05,252 --> 01:32:08,256
gretchen, you achieved
something remarkable.

2223
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:11,826
yes, i did.

2224
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:15,296
gretchen's daughter: mom?

2225
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:19,066
i think(pensar) it's time
we finish this.

2226
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:21,002
okay. i'll let you know.

2227
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:23,604
(phone receiver clatters)

2228
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:25,940
mom, are you done(feito) with(com) that?

2229
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,576
mmm-hmm. i'm done.

2230
01:32:30,844 --> 01:32:32,146
i made(fez) the murdochs

2231
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:34,882
1.5 billion in profit
last year.

2232
01:32:34,915 --> 01:32:35,950
pure profit.

2233
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:37,918
fox news
is the most(a maioria) successful

2234
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:40,855
cable franchise in history.

2235
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:40,855
(door opens)

2236
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:43,591
gretchen carlson's lawyers.

2237
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:47,361
she wants(quer) to settle.

2238
01:32:47,394 --> 01:32:49,863
it's a lot less(menos) appealing
to sue you personally

2239
01:32:49,896 --> 01:32:51,832
without rupert's money
behind you.

2240
01:32:55,869 --> 01:32:56,871
hey, ken.

2241
01:33:00,273 --> 01:33:01,275
ken.

2242
01:33:22,429 --> 01:33:24,398
(all screaming)

2243
01:33:22,429 --> 01:33:24,398
(gasps)

2244
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:27,368
(all laughing)

2245
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,270
hey! look(olhar) who's here.

2246
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,270
megyn: oh, my gosh!

2247
01:33:30,303 --> 01:33:32,673
i brought you
some small people.

2248
01:33:30,303 --> 01:33:32,673
megyn: yard! yatesy!

2249
01:33:32,706 --> 01:33:34,208
oh, my gosh.
i've missed you guys(pessoal) so much.

2250
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,076
doug: we practiced that(este) scare
for two weeks.

2251
01:33:36,109 --> 01:33:37,277
look at you.

2252
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,912
(gasps) hi.

2253
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,912
hi.

2254
01:33:38,945 --> 01:33:42,149
thatcher: i love(amar) you, mama.

2255
01:33:38,945 --> 01:33:42,149
my little(pequena) chubble-wubbles.

2256
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:44,184
we got her.

2257
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:44,184
doug: all right.

2258
01:33:44,217 --> 01:33:46,086
yardley: she was so scared.

2259
01:33:46,119 --> 01:33:47,421
(sighs)

2260
01:33:46,119 --> 01:33:47,421
thank you.

2261
01:33:47,454 --> 01:33:49,423
how are you, sweetheart?

2262
01:33:49,456 --> 01:33:51,325
i'm either damned for doing(fazendo) it

2263
01:33:51,358 --> 01:33:52,760
or damned
for not doing(fazendo) it sooner.

2264
01:33:54,995 --> 01:33:57,298
tell me my big mouth
didn't ruin our life.

2265
01:33:58,098 --> 01:33:59,100
not yet.

2266
01:34:05,872 --> 01:34:08,042
can i speak
to roger alone, please?

2267
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:18,052
susan: are you sure
you want(querer) beth here?

2268
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:20,655
well, of course.

2269
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:29,430
gretchen taped
your conversations.

2270
01:34:31,231 --> 01:34:32,766
that's a goddamn(maldito) lie.

2271
01:34:32,799 --> 01:34:34,101
for over(sobre) a year.

2272
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:38,372
beth: but...

2273
01:34:39,272 --> 01:34:40,974
you don't believe(acreditam) her?

2274
01:34:41,007 --> 01:34:43,978
your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from(a partir de) tapes.

2275
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:46,013
(stammers)

2276
01:34:48,048 --> 01:34:49,783
why didn't they
tell us before?

2277
01:34:49,816 --> 01:34:51,852
so you'd issue
complete denials.

2278
01:34:53,987 --> 01:34:55,723
so you'd have(ter) no credibility.

2279
01:35:02,362 --> 01:35:04,298
apparently,
she did her homework.

2280
01:35:12,806 --> 01:35:14,475
(kids laughing)

2281
01:35:15,809 --> 01:35:17,912
(speaking indistinctly)

2282
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:21,315
(cheers and applause)

2283
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:24,284
rudy giuliani: god bless our
next president, donald trump,

2284
01:35:24,317 --> 01:35:28,489
and god bless
the united states of america!

2285
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:31,125
usa!

2286
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:31,125
(megyn chuckles)

2287
01:35:32,092 --> 01:35:34,194
mr. giuliani's fired(disparamos) up.

2288
01:35:34,227 --> 01:35:36,230
when we come(venha) back,
we'll discuss his speech

2289
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,232
with the man
who helped write it.

2290
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:39,767
stage manager: clear.

2291
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,401
gil: (on headset)
don't react, okay?

2292
01:35:41,434 --> 01:35:42,469
mmm-hmm.

2293
01:35:42,502 --> 01:35:43,838
roger's out.

2294
01:35:47,274 --> 01:35:48,542
is that(este) sourced, gil?

2295
01:35:48,575 --> 01:35:50,544
yeah. the new york(iorque) post.

2296
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:52,412
they put him on the cover.

2297
01:35:52,445 --> 01:35:54,148
rupert's telling(dizendo) him
to let go.

2298
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:56,283
then it's a scoop.

2299
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,318
trump: we're gonna(vai) win.
we're gonna(vai) win so big.

2300
01:35:58,351 --> 01:36:00,187
thank you very(muito) much,
everybody.

2301
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,522
there is some
breaking news(notícias) tonight

2302
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:03,257
in the worlds of
media and politics.

2303
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,058
a blockbuster shakeup
at fox news.

2304
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:06,493
a dramatic fall from(a partir de) grace.

2305
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:09,496
roger ailes is out
as top boss.

2306
01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:11,231
driver: they(elas) want(querer) us
to circle the block.

2307
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,466
no. hold on.

2308
01:36:15,969 --> 01:36:17,838
beth: what's going(vai) on?

2309
01:36:15,969 --> 01:36:17,838
go around.

2310
01:36:20,907 --> 01:36:22,243
roger: i've been(estive) shut out.

2311
01:36:20,907 --> 01:36:22,243
(cell phone(telefone) beeps)

2312
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:31,785
greta: it's true.

2313
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:34,254
everything gretchen said,
it's all true.

2314
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:35,389
roger lied to me.

2315
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:37,925
neil: why?
because i'm a manager here,

2316
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,093
so i have(ter) concerns
my public defense of roger

2317
01:36:40,126 --> 01:36:41,895
could be construed
as coercive.

2318
01:36:41,928 --> 01:36:43,998
hey. huh. pants.

2319
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,533
fuck off, neil.

2320
01:36:59,212 --> 01:37:00,547
sorry to keep(guarda) you waiting.

2321
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,216
no, no, no, no, no, sit down.

2322
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:04,485
appreciate you
driving up here, roger.

2323
01:37:05,418 --> 01:37:07,254
susan estrich.

2324
01:37:05,418 --> 01:37:07,254
susan.

2325
01:37:08,288 --> 01:37:10,257
(rupert sighs)

2326
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:12,626
i hate that(este) it's come(venha) to this.

2327
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:14,161
me, too.

2328
01:37:24,571 --> 01:37:28,508
(sighs deeply)
we gave(deu) these(esses) women(mulheres) jobs.

2329
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:31,478
put them(eles) on the air,
made them(eles) famous.

2330
01:37:31,511 --> 01:37:33,380
do you think
for a goddamn(maldito) second

2331
01:37:33,413 --> 01:37:35,850
i did any damage
to any of them?

2332
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,385
no, you don't.

2333
01:37:41,054 --> 01:37:42,256
you don't, rupert.

2334
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:47,161
there's no audience
for that(este) side of the story.

2335
01:37:57,671 --> 01:37:58,806
to begin with,

2336
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:01,608
half this, you already owe him
from last(durar) year's bonus.

2337
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:03,477
and we're paying it.

2338
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,212
and paying off your(seu) contract.

2339
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:06,480
james:
consider yourself(você mesma) lucky.

2340
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:09,917
it's a contractual obligation.

2341
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:14,087
i created the murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

2342
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,490
a third of your(seu) margin.

2343
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:18,625
there are three of you.

2344
01:38:18,658 --> 01:38:20,494
i guess(acho) that(este) means
i pay for the food

2345
01:38:20,527 --> 01:38:22,329
that one of you puts
in your(seu) mouth.

2346
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:25,165
what if it's you?

2347
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:26,934
i'd have(ter) fired(disparamos) you for cause.

2348
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,302
rupert: roger,

2349
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:30,971
you built an amazing business.

2350
01:38:31,004 --> 01:38:32,907
no one can take(levar) that
away from(a partir de) you.

2351
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,677
but under(sob) the circumstances,

2352
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:40,514
this is a lot of money.

2353
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:42,182
and it won't look(olhar) good
to the people

2354
01:38:42,215 --> 01:38:43,650
that don't know(conhecer) your(seu) worth.

2355
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:45,352
take it.

2356
01:38:45,385 --> 01:38:47,254
honor your(seu) non-compete.

2357
01:38:54,661 --> 01:38:56,463
i never(nunca) cared about(cerca de) the money.

2358
01:38:57,597 --> 01:38:59,066
we know, roger.

2359
01:39:06,272 --> 01:39:07,308
okay.

2360
01:39:09,142 --> 01:39:12,012
(breathes deeply) okay.

2361
01:39:12,045 --> 01:39:14,514
i'd like(como) to go
to the newsroom with(com) you.

2362
01:39:14,547 --> 01:39:17,384
i'd like(como) us to announce
my leaving together.

2363
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:24,391
no.

2364
01:39:36,436 --> 01:39:39,006
james: the end of the leg man.

2365
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:42,343
i won't miss(perder) him.

2366
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:44,278
boys.

2367
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,982
(elevator bell(sino) dings)

2368
01:39:49,816 --> 01:39:51,185
(sighs deeply)

2369
01:39:53,319 --> 01:39:55,322
hope you two know
what you're doing.

2370
01:39:59,759 --> 01:40:03,430
once roger's office(escritório) is cleared
of handguns, i'll move in.

2371
01:40:03,463 --> 01:40:06,099
i'll run the network
till the ship's aright.

2372
01:40:06,132 --> 01:40:07,334
(cell phone(telefone) buzzing)

2373
01:40:09,502 --> 01:40:11,571
donald.

2374
01:40:11,604 --> 01:40:13,607
(elevator bell(sino) dings)

2375
01:40:11,604 --> 01:40:13,607
how's our speech coming?

2376
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,542
(chuckles) yeah.

2377
01:40:17,677 --> 01:40:20,514
protestors: (chanting)
megyn's gotta(preciso) go! ho, ho, ho!

2378
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:24,818
megyn's gotta(preciso) go! ho, ho, ho!

2379
01:40:24,851 --> 01:40:26,319
megyn: convention's
downstairs, folks.

2380
01:40:26,352 --> 01:40:27,421
reporter:
what's going(vai) on at fox?

2381
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:28,322
would you say
people are shocked?

2382
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,123
reporter: can rupert
afford to dump roger?

2383
01:40:30,156 --> 01:40:32,125
what did he do to you?
megyn. come(venha) on!

2384
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:33,794
megyn: of all the ways
this could(poderia) end,

2385
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:35,162
i didn't see this(isto) one coming.

2386
01:40:36,496 --> 01:40:38,198
gretchen carlson
got the murdochs

2387
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:40,067
to put the rights of women
above profit,

2388
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,736
if only(só) temporarily.

2389
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:45,705
and i found myself
with a job i didn't want

2390
01:40:45,738 --> 01:40:47,608
or couldn't really(verdade) leave

2391
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:50,177
even when(quando) i did.

2392
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,478
(indistinct chatter)

2393
01:40:58,351 --> 01:41:00,387
kayla:
you should(devemos) keep(guarda) that(este) out.

2394
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:02,355
bill: people, can i get
your attention, please?

2395
01:41:02,388 --> 01:41:04,491
mr. murdoch
is joining us today.

2396
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:06,493
he has a very(muito) important
statement he'd like(como) to say.

2397
01:41:07,894 --> 01:41:09,763
rupert: excuse(com licença) me, everyone.

2398
01:41:09,796 --> 01:41:11,698
i won't take(levar) long.

2399
01:41:11,731 --> 01:41:14,801
roger ailes is leaving fox.

2400
01:41:11,731 --> 01:41:14,801
(all gasp)

2401
01:41:14,834 --> 01:41:17,637
now, i want(querer) to start
by thanking roger

2402
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:20,140
for his
remarkable contribution

2403
01:41:20,173 --> 01:41:22,709
to our company
and to our country.

2404
01:41:22,742 --> 01:41:25,679
twenty years(anos) ago,
roger shared...

2405
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:26,847
kayla: here's the thing(coisa) about

2406
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,117
being sexually harassed
at work.

2407
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:31,585
it condemns you to questions.

2408
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,656
you keep(guarda) asking yourself,

2409
01:41:36,689 --> 01:41:38,158
"what did i do?

2410
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,127
"what did i say?

2411
01:41:40,793 --> 01:41:42,529
"what did i wear?

2412
01:41:42,562 --> 01:41:43,730
"what did i miss?

2413
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:46,400
"am i seen(visto) as weak?

2414
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:51,105
"will they(elas) say
i'm after(depois de) money?

2415
01:41:52,906 --> 01:41:55,175
"will they(elas) say
i'm after(depois de) attention?

2416
01:41:57,477 --> 01:41:58,812
"will i be left out?

2417
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:04,851
"will i be defined by this
for the rest of my life?"

2418
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:08,455
i will(vai) take(levar) over
as chairman and acting ceo

2419
01:42:08,488 --> 01:42:11,591
with the support of our
existing management team,

2420
01:42:11,624 --> 01:42:13,427
under bill(projeto de lei) shine.

2421
01:42:15,328 --> 01:42:18,298
kayla: if i stay, do i just
have to put up with(com) it?

2422
01:42:19,799 --> 01:42:21,735
(rupert continues
speaking indistinctly)

2423
01:42:25,538 --> 01:42:27,407
will the next place
be different?

2424
01:42:29,976 --> 01:42:32,246
or can i make(fazer) it different?

2425
01:42:34,714 --> 01:42:36,383
(employees applauding)

2426
01:42:41,688 --> 01:42:42,789
(inaudible)

2427
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:46,459
gretchen: roger always(sempre) said,

2428
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:49,363
"everyone on television
only has one real job.

2429
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:51,765
"to be likable."

2430
01:42:53,266 --> 01:42:55,468
well, i don't care
if you like(como) me,

2431
01:42:55,501 --> 01:42:57,271
only that(este) you believe(acreditam) me.

2432
01:42:58,838 --> 01:43:00,874
a lot of people, even(até) women,

2433
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:02,876
are skeptical
of harassment(assédio) claims

2434
01:43:02,909 --> 01:43:05,345
until they(elas) experience it
themselves,

2435
01:43:05,378 --> 01:43:07,247
or know(conhecer) someone(alguém) who has.

2436
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,416
let me be that(este) person for you.

2437
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:10,450
neil: as you can see,

2438
01:43:11,317 --> 01:43:12,786
it's 20 million.

2439
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:14,321
plus the apology.

2440
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:16,223
mmm.

2441
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:16,223
correct.

2442
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:18,692
i can't believe
fox agreed to the apology.

2443
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:19,893
i mean, it's unheard of.

2444
01:43:19,926 --> 01:43:21,861
i mean, that(este) never(nunca) happens.

2445
01:43:21,894 --> 01:43:23,964
but you will(vai) have(ter) to
sign that.

2446
01:43:23,997 --> 01:43:26,933
it's a strict confidentiality
agreement.

2447
01:43:26,966 --> 01:43:28,868
neil: money(dinheiro) will(vai) establish
you told(contado) the truth,

2448
01:43:28,901 --> 01:43:31,004
but no one can ever(sempre) hear(ouvir) it
directly from(a partir de) you.

2449
01:43:31,037 --> 01:43:33,473
you will(vai) be muzzled, gretchen.

2450
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,475
(sighs)

2451
01:43:42,949 --> 01:43:43,984
maybe.
