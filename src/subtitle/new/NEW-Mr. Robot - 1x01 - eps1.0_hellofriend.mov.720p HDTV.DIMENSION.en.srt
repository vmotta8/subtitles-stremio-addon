1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,143
that's lame.

2
00:00:01,144 --> 00:00:03,339
maybe i should give you a name,

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,011
but that's a slippery(escorregadio) slope.

4
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:05,923
you're only in my head.

5
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,847
we have to remember that.

6
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,628
shit.

7
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,510
it's actually happened,

8
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,622
i'm talking to an imaginary(imaginário) person.

9
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,500
what i'm about to tell you

10
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:16,839
is top secret,

11
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,938
a conspiracy(conspiração) bigger than all of us.

12
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,462
there's a powerful
group of people out there

13
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:24,502
that are secretly(secretamente) running the world.

14
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,134
i'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

15
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:29,982
the guys that are invisible.

16
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,319
the top 1% of the top
1%, the guys that play god

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,136
without permission.

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,347
and now i think they're following me.

19
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,391
this is about last night.

20
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:53,948
i should've gone to
angela's birthday party.

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,599
instead, i went to...

22
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:09,949
hey, ron.

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,403
there you go.

24
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,599
you're ron.

25
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:56,836
but your real name is rohit mehta.

26
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:58,619
you changed it to ron when you bought

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,124
your first ron's coffee shop

28
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,806
six years ago.

29
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,645
now you got 17 of 'em with
8 more coming next quarter.

30
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,466
may i help you with something?

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,902
i like coming here 'cause
your wi-fi was fast.

32
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:15,041
i mean, you're one of the few spots

33
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,811
that has a fiber(fibra) connection
with gigabit speed.

34
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:19,113
it's good.

35
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,077
so good, it scratched
that part of my mind, part

36
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:26,838
that doesn't allow good
to exist without condition,

37
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,502
so i started intercepting(interceptar) all the traffic

38
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:30,772
on your network.

39
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,060
that's when i noticed something strange.

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,815
it's when i decided to hack you.

41
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,583
- hack...
- i know you run a website

42
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,113
- called plato's boys.
- pardon me?

43
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:44,799
you're using tor networking
to keep the servers(servidores) anonymous.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,850
you made it really hard

45
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,608
for anyone to see it, but i saw it.

46
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,517
the onion(cebola) routing(roteamento) protocol,

47
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,799
it's not as anonymous(anônimo) as you think it is.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,799
whoever's in control of the exit nodes

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,799
is also in control of the traffic,

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,577
which makes me...

51
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,799
the one in control.

52
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,799
i must ask you to kindly(gentilmente) leave.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,734
i own everything. all your emails.

54
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,298
all your files.

55
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,799
all your... pics.

56
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,140
get out of here right now,

57
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,954
- or i'll call the...
- police?

58
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:18,998
you want them to find out

59
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,239
about the 100 terabytes
of child pornography

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,591
you serve to your 400,000 users?

61
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,917
personally, man, i was

62
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,600
hoping it was just gonna be

63
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,424
some bdsm stuff.

64
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:33,687
you realize how much
simpler that would have been?

65
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,099
i did not hurt anyone.

66
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,099
i never did.

67
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,934
that's my...

68
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,497
personal life.

69
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,679
i understand what it's like

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,729
to be different.

71
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,507
i'm very different too.

72
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,312
i mean, i don't jerk off
to little kids, but...

73
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,050
i don't know how to talk to people.

74
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,699
my dad was the only one i could talk to.

75
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,399
but he died.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,260
i'm sorry to hear that.

77
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,038
- how did he pass, may i ask?
- leukemia.

78
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:39,885
he definitely got it from
radiation at the company

79
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:42,133
he worked at, though i couldn't prove it.

80
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:44,559
now he's dead.

81
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,900
company's fine, though.

82
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,770
oh... hey.

83
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,699
it's okay, rohit.

84
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,967
you don't have to worry anymore.

85
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,899
i don't understand.

86
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,800
are you blackmailing(chantageando) me?

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,578
so that's what this is about...

88
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,500
money.

89
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,637
that's all you care about, huh?

90
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:19,299
no.

91
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,166
if i pay you now,

92
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:24,073
you'll want more and more.

93
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,326
no matter how much i give.

94
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,699
you will inform the police anyway.

95
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,699
i won't pay you, sir.

96
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,039
remember, you also broke the law.

97
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,999
actually, you're right.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,809
partly.

99
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:46,582
see, i usually do this kind
of thing from my computer,

100
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,778
but this time i wanted to do it afk.

101
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,699
in person.

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,961
trying to work on my social anxiety.

103
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:56,334
but there's always the
threat of you fleeing

104
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,710
after i call you out.

105
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,945
you'd tell your sys admin
to take your servers(servidores) down,

106
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,246
wipe all the data.

107
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,738
so i made sure to include the current time

108
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,988
and... and location on my anonymous(anônimo) tip.

109
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,695
wait. hold on. i'll give you the money.

110
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:11,748
i'll pay you.

111
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:13,609
how much do you want? i'll pay you.

112
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,155
that's the part you
were wrong about, rohit.

113
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:20,443
i don't give a shit about money.

114
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,730
now i'm being followed.

115
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,068
the higher ups don't like
someone with my powers.

116
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,762
in three short minutes, i
destroyed a man's business,

117
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:47,237
life, existence.

118
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,592
- i deleted(excluído) him.
- hey!

119
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,267
hey, you. hey, kiddo.

120
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:56,513
what's happening?

121
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:03,983
exciting time in the world right now.

122
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,951
exciting time.

123
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:31,521
but i'm only a
vigilante hacker by night.

124
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:34,526
by day, just a regular
cyber security engineer,

125
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:39,132
employee number er28-0652.

126
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:41,972
elliot!

127
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:44,981
in here.

128
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:49,999
- what's up?
- el.

129
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,572
all over the price...
yeah, i can totally...

130
00:07:58,573 --> 00:07:59,879
i can totally handle it.

131
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,886
they were hacked(hackeado) again last night.

132
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:03,915
gideon...

133
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,611
that's my childhood friend angela.

134
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,634
she can be a bit high strung(amarrado) sometimes,

135
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:09,749
but trust me... she's one of the good ones.

136
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:10,876
what am i looking at?

137
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,408
- is this the log file?
- this was a rudy attack.

138
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,085
this is awesome.

139
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,611
- gideon, will you answer me?
- awesome?

140
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:19,098
you think this is awesome?
this is killing us, elliot.

141
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,617
- gideon, i'm not...
- angela!

142
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:24,115
let's just see how this meeting goes today.

143
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:26,718
their networks(redes) are getting
attacked every week.

144
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,133
who knows if they'll
still even be a client.

145
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,432
- they're coming in?
- hey, what did we say

146
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,663
about the dress code?

147
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,132
all right, now, look over those logs.

148
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,710
and be ready this afternoon in
case they have any questions.

149
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:43,985
- okay?
- okay.

150
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,763
- start smoking again?
- did you not get my texts(texto s) last night?

151
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,123
i sent you exactly 13 of them.

152
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:54,248
yeah, i'm sorry. i couldn't make it.

153
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,987
you promised me that you
were gonna try this time.

154
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:15,894
stop thinking about something else

155
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,901
when i'm talking to you.

156
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,154
i hate when you do that.

157
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:23,364
sorry. i was thinking about work.

158
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,699
maybe that's why gideon loves you so much.

159
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,699
he thanks me all the
time for bringing you in.

160
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,911
but for some reason, i think
you secretly(secretamente) hate it here.

161
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,699
she was right. i
liked most of the people,

162
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,590
but our business, a cyber security firm

163
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:39,334
that protects(protege) corporations... i
can't think of anything i hate more.

164
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:43,183
no, i love it here.

165
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,163
i'm sorry. i'm just in a bad mood.

166
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,955
i'm late on my last two
student loan payments,

167
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:57,699
and i can't get gideon to give me a raise.

168
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
- hey...
- hi.

169
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,561
yo, buddy. missed you last night.

170
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,707
- where were you?
- gotta go. big meeting today.

171
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:11,778
- did you find out what happened?
- yeah.

172
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,436
he said he was working.

173
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:14,736
oh, come on. you gotta talk to him.

174
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,022
we're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

175
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,974
he can't stand me. and you know why.

176
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:23,289
angela, i can't have that
kind of negativityin my life.

177
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,699
that's exactly what i'm talking about.

178
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,699
what are you thinking about?

179
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,699
nothing.

180
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,699
you want to know what i'm thinking about?

181
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,699
first time you came to me.

182
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,266
i didn't exactly come to krista.

183
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,699
i was forced here. but i do like her.

184
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,248
hacking her was simple.
her password: dylan 2791.

185
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,539
favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

186
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,510
though she's a psychologist,

187
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,245
she's really bad at reading people.

188
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,299
but i'm good at reading people.

189
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,833
i look for the worst in them.

190
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,599
i know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

191
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,599
i know she was devastated(devastado) by it

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,599
and has been dating losers
on eharmony ever since.

193
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,899
her most recent foray... michael hansen.

194
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,013
i searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

195
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,303
no linkedin, no facebook, nothing.

196
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,102
something about him bugs(insetos) me,

197
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:32,745
scratching that part of my mind again.

198
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:35,264
but i'll hack him soon enough. i always do.

199
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,300
i know you're not yelling like before,

200
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,599
which is good.

201
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,799
but i can tell you're
still holding on to it.

202
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,370
and we need to work on
your anger issues, elliot.

203
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,099
you're angry at everyone, at society...

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,061
f... society.

205
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:50,199
i know you have a lot to be angry about,

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,958
but keeping it to yourself and
staying quiet like you're doing...

207
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,707
it's not going to help you.

208
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,782
there's pain underneath. that's
where our work needs to go.

209
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:07,755
what is it about society
that disappoints(desilude) you so much?

210
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:16,508
oh, i don't know.

211
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:19,381
is it that we collectively
thought steve jobs

212
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:21,332
was a great man, even when we knew

213
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,750
he made billions(bilhões) off the backs of children?

214
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,927
or maybe it's that it feels like
all our heroes are counterfeit.

215
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,287
the world itself's just one big hoax.

216
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,343
spamming with our running
commentary of bullshit

217
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:42,321
masquerading as insight, our
social media faking(fingindo) as intimacy.

218
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:47,010
or is it that we voted(votado) for this?

219
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:49,245
not with our rigged
elections, but with our things,

220
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,417
our property, our money.

221
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:54,134
i'm not saying anything new.
we all know why we do this,

222
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,691
not because hunger(fome) games
books makes us happy

223
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,242
but because we wanna be sedated.

224
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,252
because it's painful not to pretend,

225
00:13:01,253 --> 00:13:04,566
because we're cowards.

226
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,542
f... society.

227
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:10,633
elliot.
you're not saying anything.

228
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,003
- what's wrong?
- nothing.

229
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,610
don't be frustrated.

230
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:26,490
- why shouldn't i be?
- you're different than most.

231
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,409
you at least try.

232
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:33,629
you at least understand.

233
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:39,514
- understand what?
- what it's like to feel alone.

234
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,521
you understand the pain.

235
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:47,059
you want to protect people from it.

236
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,997
you want to protect me from it.

237
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:54,147
i respect that about you.

238
00:13:58,832 --> 00:13:59,824
why do you think i know

239
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:03,818
- what it's like to feel alone?
- shit! from her emails!

240
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,994
- elliot?
- i don't know.

241
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,354
let's talk about last night.

242
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:16,289
did you go to angela's birthday party?

243
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,551
yeah. it was nice.

244
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:26,638
- did you try to talk to anyone?
- sure.

245
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,198
i got a girl's number.

246
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,262
you did?

247
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:33,326
she's cute.

248
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:36,422
she likes the hunger(fome) games.

249
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:42,796
you're hiding again, elliot.

250
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:47,510
when you hide, your delusions(delírios) come back.

251
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,386
it's a slippery(escorregadio) slope.

252
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:55,485
let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

253
00:14:55,486 --> 00:15:00,684
- are they still there?
- no,

254
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:03,364
i... told you they're gone.

255
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:06,699
the meds you gave me

256
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,203
yo, man.

257
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,203
do you wanna, uh...

258
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:18,201
- you wanna do lunch today?
- uh, yeah...

259
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:20,245
- i got other plans.
- other plans. right.

260
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:24,399
that's... what you said the
last three times i asked you.

261
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,394
look, bud, you... and angela

262
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:29,391
have been close for a long time,

263
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:32,386
and that's even more
reason why i want us to be

264
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,383
on good terms.

265
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:38,041
i... i just... i feel like things
have been awkward between us.

266
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,566
- don't you?
- i'm okay

267
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,382
with it being awkward between us.

268
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:47,664
um, yeah. i... i'm...
i'm not okay with that.

269
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:52,520
um... look, man, i love
angela, and i want us to...

270
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:55,482
to get along for her sake.
i mean, that's what i'm...

271
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:58,445
that's what i'm here for. i just, i...

272
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,949
- i don't normally do stuff...
- am i crazy not to like this guy?

273
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:03,986
among some of his facebook likes

274
00:16:03,987 --> 00:16:05,967
are george w. bush's decision points,

275
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,947
revenge of the fallen,

276
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:10,918
and the music of josh groban.

277
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,577
must i really justify(justificar) myself any further?

278
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:15,398
i'm working on that shit, you know?

279
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:20,089
his was the easiest(mais fácil) to hack.
password was 123456seven.

280
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,988
i witnessed(testemunhado) his first "i love
you" with angela over gchat,

281
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:29,450
then i witnessed(testemunhado) the first of
many infidelities(infidelidades) with stella b.

282
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,385
i've never done anything
like this before...

283
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:33,703
i've thought about telling angela,

284
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,280
but she has shitty taste in
men, and i'm not quite ready

285
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,204
to see what comes after this just yet.

286
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,336
you like music. i like music.

287
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,365
maroon 5.

288
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,044
plus i can manage ollie
easier than the others.

289
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,438
for now, anyway.

290
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,423
and that's all i mean.

291
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,452
i just want you to know that.

292
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,882
i like you, bro, and...

293
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,912
i want you to like me too.

294
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,956
i understand.

295
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,695
i'll try harder.

296
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:59,649
that's cool, man.

297
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,806
hey, whenever you're
ready, i'd love to just...

298
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,815
chill.

299
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,282
oh... forgot about your...

300
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:12,265
no touching thing.

301
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,521
truth is, i shouldn't hate
ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

302
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:20,566
he's too dumb to be bad.

303
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:25,132
in fact, when i think about
the really bad people...

304
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,993
e corp, the largest
conglomerate in the world...

305
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:34,757
they're so big, they're
literally everywhere.

306
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:37,979
a perfect monster of modern society.

307
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,801
the e might as well stand for evil.

308
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:44,406
- and all of life's necessities...
- in fact, after a thorough,

309
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,935
intensive self-reprogramming,
that's all my mind hears,

310
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,042
sees, or reads(lê) when
they pop up in my world.

311
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:50,446
that was have to offer.

312
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:53,399
together, we can change
the world, with e...

313
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,399
evil corp.

314
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,931
krista would have a shit
fit if she knew i did that.

315
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:01,671
but that's what they are...
a conglomerate(conglomerado) of evil.

316
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,970
- and now i have to help them.
- there are six on-site engineers

317
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:06,210
on your account.

318
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,546
- plus a few off-site...
- there he is, terry colby, the cto.

319
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,889
even though he's the head technology guy

320
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,286
at one of the biggest companies
in the world, he owns a blackberry.

321
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,196
so this is it right here.

322
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,917
but also looks like he doesn't
see a terminal very often

323
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:23,251
he's not a techie. he's a moron.

324
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:27,824
an arrogant(arrogante) moron. the worst kind.

325
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:36,037
oh, hi. tyrell wellick.

326
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:38,434
i'm senior vice president, technology.

327
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:44,327
- elliot. just a tech.
- don't be so humble.

328
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:47,214
you know, i started out
exactly where you are,

329
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:50,259
and... to be honest, you
know, my heart is still there.

330
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:53,784
so i see you're running gnome.

331
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,128
you know, i'm actually on kde myself.

332
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:00,235
i know this desktop(área de trabalho) environment
is supposed to be better but...

333
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,224
you know what they say.

334
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:06,337
- old habits... they die hard.
- an executive(executivo) running linux with...

335
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,009
yeah, i know what you're thinking.

336
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,098
i'm an executive. i mean...

337
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,093
why am i even running linux?

338
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:15,099
again... old habits.

339
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,359
it's gonna be fun working with you.

340
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:23,899
i should join the rest of the group.

341
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,899
bonsoir, elliot.

342
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,599
sometimes i dream of saving the world.

343
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:42,122
saving everyone from the invisible hand,

344
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:44,899
one that brands(marcas) us with an employee badge.

345
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,935
the one that forces us to work for them...

346
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:55,821
the one that controls(controles) us every
day without us knowing it.

347
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,899
but i can't stop it.

348
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,899
i'm not that special.

349
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,899
i'm just anonymous.

350
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,899
i'm just alone.

351
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,688
if it weren't for qwerty,

352
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:15,899
i'd be completely empty.

353
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,152
i hate when i can't hold in my loneliness.

354
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,634
this crying has been happening too often,

355
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,727
every other week now.

356
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,599
what do normal people do
when they get this sad?

357
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,899
they reach out to friends
or family, i think.

358
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,899
that's not an option.

359
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,899
i do morphine.

360
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,744
the key to doing morphine
without turning into a junkie

361
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:59,625
is to limit yourself
to 30 milligrams(miligramas) a day.

362
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,873
anything more

363
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:03,799
just builds(constrói) up your tolerance.

364
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,899
i check every pill(comprimido) i get for purity.

365
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:09,899
i have 8 milligram(miligrama) suboxone for maintenance

366
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,899
in case i go through withdrawals.

367
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,899
shit! i'm out again.

368
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:22,193
- how much?
- on the house.

369
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:25,599
no, shayla. not doing that.

370
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,199
okay? this is just a regular drug deal

371
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,199
- like it always is.
- fine.

372
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,934
so what are you you to tonight?

373
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:33,899
'cause i tried to post
something on your facebook

374
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,559
and couldn't find you.

375
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,427
i'm not on facebook.

376
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:41,039
- what? why not?
- 'cause i hate facebook.

377
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,899
that's crazy.

378
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,579
well... you want to do these together then?

379
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:53,600
pure molly...

380
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,230
don't ever make
decisions when you're on morphine.

381
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,299
instagram check-in for
krista at pierre loti.

382
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,913
okay, michael hansen.

383
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:27,357
time to find out who you really are.

384
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,299
- thank you. bye.
- bye.

385
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,199
taxi!

386
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:31,199
uh, hi... i just left my
keys in one of your cabs.

387
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,199
56y2.

388
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:35,499

389
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,599

390
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:43,199

00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,413

399
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:23,900
hey.

400
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:28,899
may i borrow your phone?

401
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,899
mine's dead. i need to call my mom.

402
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,299
thank you.

403
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,399
no answer. thanks anyway.

404
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:23,773
- angela, is everything okay?
- i need you to come to allsafe.

405
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,073
you're there? it's 3:00 in the morning.

406
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:29,159
they attacked evil corp servers
again, but it's bad this time.

407
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,000
it's a ddos attack.

408
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,777
- did you call lloyd? he's on call.
- yeah, he's here.

409
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:38,584
- is he talking to their tech department?
- he's online with them, but so far nothing.

410
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,031
i don't think that lloyd can handle this.

411
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,802
look, gideon just put me on this account.

412
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,472
i can't screw up in my first week.

413
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:50,099
i need you. please.

414
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,341
i'll be right there.

415
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:07,107
- finally!
- calm down... it's only been an hour.

416
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:11,926
yeah, well, an hourin evil corp time is
like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

417
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,561
actually, i calculated(calculado) that.

418
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:15,573
that's exactly how much they lost.

419
00:26:15,855 --> 00:26:17,826
don't worry. i got you.

420
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,199
lloyd, what's up?

421
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,199
lloyd!

422
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:25,286
elliot. this is bad.

423
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,868
worst ddos attack i've ever seen.

424
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:29,441
- did you reconfigure(reconfigurar) the dns?
- yes!

425
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,683
- stop the services.
- i already stopped the services,

426
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:34,060
tries to reboot(reinicializar) the servers
but they're not coming back up.

427
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:37,315
dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting
their entire network right now.

428
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,982
they just started reporting on the outage.

429
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,475
shit. this is worse than
i thought. they're in the network?

430
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:09,418
what's the status update?

431
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,923
is here. i thought we
set up security protocols

432
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:15,319
so that this doesn't happen.

433
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:17,688
- where's the attack coming from?
- everywhere, obviously.

434
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:21,110
- the usa, finland, thailand, kuwait...
- start restarting(reiniciando) the services, load sharing,

435
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,248
redirect the traffic.
call prolexic for help.

436
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:27,534
- wait. what?
- i don't think this is just a ddos attack.

437
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:31,946
i think they got a rootkit
sitting inside the servers.

438
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:34,827
- what's a rootkit?
- it's like a crazy serial

439
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:36,299
rapist with a very big dick.

440
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:40,287
- jesus, lloyd.
- sorry. it's malicious(malicioso) code that completely

441
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:42,861
takes over their system.
it can delete(excluir) system files

442
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,394
and stop programs. viruses, worms...

443
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:47,102
- how do we stop it?
- that's the thing.

444
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:49,245
it's fundamentally
invisible... you can't stop it.

445
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:50,619
all of their servers(servidores) are timing out.

446
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,934
none of them are coming back up.

447
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,043
that's because every
time we restart(reiniciar) the server

448
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:56,005
the virus(vírus) replicates itself during boot(bota) up

449
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,142
and crashes(acidentes) the host.

450
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,310
_

451
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:00,182
how are we supposed to bring up the network

452
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:03,984
- if we can't restart(reiniciar) the servers?
- we can't.

453
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,199
which is what they wanted.

454
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,691
by defending(defender) ourselves, we ended
up spreadingthe(espalhando o) virus(vírus) everywhere.

455
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,898
only thing we can do

456
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,199
is we've gotta take the
whole system offline,

457
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,228
wipe the infected(infetado) servers
clean, then bring them back up.

458
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,199
you're coming with me.

459
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,174
- yeah.
- lloyd.

460
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,402
tell everybody to start
taking everything offline.

461
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:29,120
- on it.
- uh, the server(servidor) farm in dulles.

462
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,724
we're gonna need the jet.

463
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,045
they're booting(inicialização) the network back up.

464
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:48,867
now, you're downloading
the logs, right because...

465
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,809
- stop. tell him to stop.
- what?

466
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,099
don't start the boot
sequence. you guys missed one.

467
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,864
there's an infected(infetado) server(servidor) up and running.

468
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
what's the eta before it hits this server?

469
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,499
the backup server(servidor) up and running?

470
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,273
it's ready, but it's
not configured(configurado) for auto switch.

471
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,705
we need to redirect
the traffic, need to switch dns.

472
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,761
you got this, you got this, you got this.

473
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:28,352
- this is impossible.
- you got this, you got this, you got this.

474
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,323
it's almost at the back server!

475
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:41,300
we still up?

476
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:51,794
we're okay.

477
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,037
yeah.

478
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:04,625
hank.

479
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:06,427
i'm gonna take a look at
the infected(infetado) server, okay?

480
00:30:06,428 --> 00:30:10,706
- give me a minute.
- yeah. uh... i'll meet you at the elevators.

481
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:18,735
they must have
left a mark or something.

482
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:20,652
every hacker loves attention.

483
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,379
they don't just do ddos
attacks for no reason.

484
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:32,526
this is it. fsociety.

485
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,999
is that supposed to be a joke?

486
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,371
this was way too easy. they
didn't hide it well at all.

487
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:41,983
_

488
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:45,089
_

489
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:48,385
this note is for me.

490
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,785
they're telling me to leave it here.

491
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:55,052
but why? doesn't matter.

492
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,276
time to shut them down.

493
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,468
why can't i delete(excluir) it?

494
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,981
i don't want to delete
it. i want it to stay.

495
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:07,199
what's wrong with me?

496
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,635
i'll reconfigure(reconfigurar) the
access to the root(raiz) directory

497
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:19,857
so only i can use it. and no one will know.

498
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,602
for you, sir.

499
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,202
- did you know that i'm gay?
- uh...

500
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,231
- no.
- hmm.

501
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:49,099
consider this me coming
out to you then, okay?

502
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,699
it's hard because i don't
like to talk about my sex life.

503
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,699
but my partner, he gets very paranoid.

504
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,699
he thinks i'm ashamed of...

505
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,699
he wants me to be more public about it, so,

506
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,699
anyway, i'm gay.

507
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,399
- thanks.
- yeah.

508
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:19,907
hey, man, don't worry about it.

509
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,999
hackers have a short attention span.

510
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,729
they'll get bored, harass(molestar) someone else.

511
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,799
evil corp is thinking about leaving us.

512
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,936
and i don't know if i can blame them.

513
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,633
they could have called
their other security teams.

514
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:39,584
- mm.
- they called you.

515
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,700
well, somebody over there likes us,

516
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:45,636
but terry colby, he's getting the pressure.

517
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:49,622
and he calls the shots.

518
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:52,799
evil corp is 80% of our business.

519
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,799
if we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.

520
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,705
it's gonna be it...

521
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,799
for me.

522
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:11,402
i feel like i can talk to you.

523
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,745
i mean, more than the others, anyway.

524
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,198
i'm sure, in a weird way,
you'll be happy if we went under.

525
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,380
oh, come on. come on.

526
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,473
i know you hate wearing
those stupid shirts.

527
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,799
gideon?

528
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:44,999
i promise i'll find them.

529
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,774
evil corp service
should be back up soon enough.

530
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:03,755
i'll take a look at the dat
file. i'll ask my irc contacts

531
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,549
about fsociety when i get home.

532
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,606
i've never seen their
name on the boards(pranchas) though.

533
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:09,799
they've gotta be new, but they're good.

534
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,799
rough night?

535
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,419
i'm getting off here.

536
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,599
i think you should come with me.

537
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,799
but only if you didn't delete(excluir) it.

538
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,372
you deleted(excluído) it, we got
nothing to talk about.

539
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:39,661
are you talking to me?

540
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,051
stand clear of
the closing doors, please.

541
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,429
- who are you?
- we gotta wait for the q.

542
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:14,819
- then what?
- then we're going to brooklyn.

543
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,635
out by coney island.

544
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,475
why?

545
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:24,325
what's there?

546
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:28,799
obviously you're gonna
ask a lot of questions.

547
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,773
it's weird what you're
doing right now, i get it.

548
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,699
i-i can't tell you
anything until we get there.

549
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:46,913
can't smoke in here.

550
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,685
you've been following me.

551
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,453
why?

552
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,599
what do you want from me?

553
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,599
my dad was a petty(mesquinho) thief.

554
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,599
never could hold down a job.

555
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,853
so, he just robbed,
convenience stores, shops,

556
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:15,923
small-time stuff.

557
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,449
one time, he sat me down, he
told me something i never forgot.

558
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,311
he said, "everyone steals.
that's how it works.

559
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:28,445
you think people out there are
getting exactly what they deserve? no.

560
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:30,599
they're getting paid over or under,

561
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,988
but someone in the chain
always gets bamboozled.

562
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:40,599
i steal, son, but i don't get caught.

563
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,599
that's my contract with society.

564
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,599
now if you can catch me
stealing, i'll go to jail.

565
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,296
but if you can't, then
i've earned the money."

566
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:56,318
i respected(respeitado) that, man.

567
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,835
i thought that shit was
cool as a little kid.

568
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:08,599
a few years after that,

569
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,599
they finally caught him.

570
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,664
sent him to jail.

571
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,875
dies five years later.
my respect goes with him.

572
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,456
i thought he was free doing
what he did, but he wasn't.

573
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:28,265
he was in prison.

574
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,451
just like you are now, elliot.

575
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,599
but i'm gonna break you out.

576
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:39,432
- why would you guys actually meet irl?
- you remember that hacker group o-megz?

577
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:41,274
they got outed(pisado) by their
own leader to the fbi,

578
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,967
and six hackers went to prison for it?

579
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:44,430
you know how they got 'em?

580
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:45,995
they went on the dude's computer,

581
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:51,613
tracked 'em all down through emails,
vpn sessions, chat messages, texts.

582
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:53,599
one guy, and the whole thing comes down.

583
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,719
- it's what's called...
- a central point of failure.

584
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,085
right. because they
refused to meet in person,

585
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,041
they compromised(comprometido) each other every time
they sent so much as a smiley(risonho) face.

586
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:07,664
the rule here is, it's
done here, and only here.

587
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,002
it ends when you walk out that
door, and begins when you walk in.

588
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:17,041
our encryption(criptografia) is the real world.

589
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,662
- how do you talk to each other then?
- we don't.

590
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:23,583
we come and go, work on
the project when we can.

591
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,599
- how do you trust them?
- i give them an exercise.

592
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,591
if they pass, they join us.

593
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:34,484
- if they fail...
- the ddos attack last night,

594
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:38,369
you were testing me.

595
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:47,318
you said there was a project.

596
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:50,866
- what's the project?
- that'll come later.

597
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:53,228
i just wanted you to see the place.

598
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,899
there's not much you can do without a cpu.

599
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:08,256
i'm crazy.

600
00:40:08,257 --> 00:40:10,899
i have to be crazy because
that didn't just happen, right?

601
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,913
this is a delusion. is this a
delusion? shit, i'm a schizo.

602
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:19,973
have i really lost it this time?
no, no. last night happened.

603
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:22,338
it was real. angela called
me. i was at allsafe.

604
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,899
evil corp's servers(servidores) were compromised.

605
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,899
those are facts, not delusions.

606
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,508
i know. i know, i know i
realize i'm saying all of this

607
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,957
to an imaginary(imaginário) person, but i created you.

608
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,393
i didn't create this.

609
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,081
oh, thank god you're here.

610
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:39,727
i was just about to go
wait in the starbucks.

611
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,082
you live in a bad neighborhood.

612
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,736
- do you know that?
- i do know that.

613
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:50,049
do you want to get high and
watch your favorite movie?

614
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:54,511
oh, you saved our asses last night. i
thought gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

615
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:57,029
where have you been?

616
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:02,872
- i thought you'd be sleeping.
- i... yeah, i fell asleep on the train.

617
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,464
that sounds like such a lie,

618
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,670
but, whatever. i don't want
to get into that right now.

619
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,054
so you want to do this?

620
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:22,739
i miss qwerty. i hope she still loves me.

621
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,699
shit.

622
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,872
she wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

623
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:37,931
- give me a minute and i'll get rid of her.
- that's okay.

624
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:41,851
um... this is great.

625
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,897
- elliot, i'm happy for you.
- no, it's not like that.

626
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:49,440
well, maybe it should be, you
know? it's good that you're...

627
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,464
dating.

628
00:41:56,499 --> 00:41:58,033
well, i'll see you on monday.

629
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,499
we can do movie night next time.

630
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,217
- i promise, okay?
- yeah.

631
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:12,906
have fun.

632
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:29,275
mm, elliot?

633
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:34,672
oh, shit. is it wednesday?

634
00:42:34,673 --> 00:42:37,740
- shayla.
- i have to move my car.

635
00:42:37,741 --> 00:42:41,657
shayla, leave.

636
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:45,499
now.

637
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:50,670
no mention of mr. robot(robô) anywhere.

638
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,499
no mention of fsociety.

639
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,016
not on any of the hacker boards.

640
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:57,911
not on irc, forums, blogs,
no one's heard of them.

641
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:05,879
property was owned by fun society
amusement, llc for 13 years.

642
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,739
owner was shot a killed
a year and a half ago.

643
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,215
no owner since.

644
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:13,899
and the ownership(propriedade) history before
that is sparse(escasso) to nonexistent.

645
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:17,433
this guy is good. very good.

646
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:27,035
doesn't matter. their arcade
network's ip is in the dat file.

647
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:33,309
that'll be enough to turn them in.

648
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,599
what's your ask, mr. robot?

649
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,592
hey, man,

650
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,141
- where's your boss?
- okay, cut the bullshit.

651
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:11,528
when are you going to give us
access to the root(raiz) directory?

652
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:14,907
- what? dude, come on.

653
00:44:14,908 --> 00:44:16,499
i wrote that rootkit.

654
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,499
i still have to put
colby's ip in the dat file.

655
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,583
dickhead.

656
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,851
elliot! good news.

657
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:33,908
i scored(marcado) the last bag of
twinkies from gristedes.

658
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:37,893
- you want one?
- she just called me a dickhead.

659
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:41,266
yeah, that's darlene.

660
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:45,279
hey, you like ferris wheels?

661
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,562
ah, it's beautiful.

662
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:53,045
gets better the higher up you go, you know?

663
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:57,499
oh, i love it up here.

664
00:44:58,075 --> 00:45:03,183
- you like it?
- i'm here to tell you i'm turning you in.

665
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:07,354
- i'm giving them all the information.
- let me tell you why you're really here.

666
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,008
you're here because you sense
something wrong with the world.

667
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,568
something you can't explain.

668
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:16,660
but...

669
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:19,419
you know it controls(controles) you
and everyone you care about.

670
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:22,406
what are you talking about?

671
00:45:25,353 --> 00:45:27,093
money.

672
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:31,272
money hasn't been real since
we got off the gold standard.

673
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:32,944
it's become virtual.

674
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:36,623
software. the operating
system of our world.

675
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:42,852
and, elliot, we are on the verge
of taking down this virtual reality.

676
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:46,785
think about it.

677
00:45:47,334 --> 00:45:51,534
what if you could take
down one conglomerate?

678
00:45:52,153 --> 00:45:55,531
a conglomerate(conglomerado) so deeply entrenched

679
00:45:55,532 --> 00:46:00,278
in the world's economy, that
too big to fail to describing(descrevendo) it.

680
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:03,345
you want to create
another financial meltdown

681
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:06,917
like the one we just had, but way worse.

682
00:46:06,918 --> 00:46:08,612
yeah, why would i want that?

683
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:10,258
everyone would lose their money.

684
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:12,340
what if i told you that this conglomerate

685
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:16,010
just so happens to own 70% of the
global consumer(consumidor) credit industry?

686
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:18,586
huh? if we hit their
data center just right,

687
00:46:18,587 --> 00:46:20,919
we could systematically
format all the servers,

688
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,029
- including backup.
- that would erase(apagar) all...

689
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,250
all the debt we owe them.

690
00:46:25,251 --> 00:46:28,428
every record of every credit
card, loan, and mortgage

691
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:29,891
would be wiped clean.

692
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,193
it would be impossible to reinforce

693
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:33,658
outdated paper records.

694
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,688
it would all be gone.

695
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,287
the single biggest incident

696
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:43,350
of wealth(riqueza) redistribution(redistribuição) in history.

697
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:53,208
evil corp. the conglomerate.

698
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,106
that's why you picked me.

699
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:56,672
because i work at allsafe.

700
00:46:56,674 --> 00:46:59,836
tomorrow, allsafe is going to get a visit

701
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,899
from the fbi and the u.s. cyber command.

702
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:08,329
you are going to modify(modificar) the dat file

703
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:13,158
and put colby's terminal
ip address in there.

704
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,789
terry colby?

705
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,919
you're gonna frame him? no
one's gonna believe that.

706
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,216
i met him, he's a moron.

707
00:47:22,218 --> 00:47:24,082
so are the fbi.

708
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:25,814
even if they don't believe he did it,

709
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:29,211
they'll believe he gave
someone access to it.

710
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:30,777
yeah, he'll just go to jail.

711
00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:33,675
- what good will that do?
- you don't take down a conglomerate

712
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:35,606
by shooting them in the heart.

713
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:37,171
that's the thing about conglomerates,

714
00:47:37,173 --> 00:47:39,169
they don't have hearts.

715
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:41,934
you take them down limb(membro) by limb.

716
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:43,333
and as they unravel,

717
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:46,597
their illusion(ilusão) of control unravels.

718
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:57,505
- who are you?
- that'll come later.

719
00:47:57,556 --> 00:48:02,183
right now, you have a lot to think about.

720
00:48:02,185 --> 00:48:04,814
you have to change the dat file

721
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:07,878
and put colby's ip in there.

722
00:48:10,545 --> 00:48:13,074
you do that,

723
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:15,239
you have set in motion
the largest(maior) revolution

724
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:18,603
the world will ever see.

725
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:56,637
- so, what do we got?
- so, if you'll take a look

726
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,135
at the first page of your agenda...

727
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:01,599
you're the one who stopped the hack.

728
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,696
you know, the gals(galets) in
analysis said this was a tough one.

729
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:06,129
all things being equal,

730
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:08,693
it should have shut us down for days, so...

731
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:11,124
you did good.

732
00:51:11,126 --> 00:51:14,654
okay.

733
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:18,052
we should start with
our account executive, angela.

734
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:19,850
okay, we first noticed the breach

735
00:51:19,852 --> 00:51:23,847
at 2:07 a.m. eastern
standard on friday night.

736
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:28,263
- you mean, saturday?
- sorry, yes,

737
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,278
technically, saturday morning.

738
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:32,805
yeah, okay, angela,
that's what we're here for.

739
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:35,104
the technicals.

740
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:37,225
right.

741
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:41,481
yes. anyway, he arrived at the office

742
00:51:41,482 --> 00:51:43,607
- at 2:35 and i instru...
- okay, wait, wait, wait.

743
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:46,239
so that's almost a half hour
after the initial(inicial) breach.

744
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,079
why didn't anyone pipe
in from their laptops?

745
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,358
- it's not protocol...
- it wouldn't have been secure

746
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,755
if someone terminaled(terminal) in on this.

747
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:57,452
it was the smarter move
to have someone come in

748
00:51:57,454 --> 00:52:00,411
- so they can log in on a secure line.
- exactly.

749
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,724
- then lloyd was able to...
- just... just actually,

750
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:04,638
just one second.

751
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,975
yeah.

752
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:19,833
you know, i, uh,

753
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:23,862
i always loved this view.

754
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,882
now that that's taken care of,

755
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:43,646
let's pick it up where we left off.

756
00:52:43,648 --> 00:52:44,944
what happened to angela?

757
00:52:44,946 --> 00:52:46,777
she knows more about what happened.

758
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:48,975
she's not going to work out
for us, not on this level.

759
00:52:48,977 --> 00:52:51,731
we need to stick to the
more tech savvy here.

760
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:57,235
now, let's get to the heart of this thing

761
00:52:57,237 --> 00:52:59,367
because i can't sit here

762
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:02,584
and look through a packet
for the next 20 minutes.

763
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:07,178
all right, just who did
this? is it that hard?

764
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:13,431
- who did this?
- i found the configuration(configuração) file

765
00:53:13,432 --> 00:53:16,048
of the rootkit with a
pattern of ip addresses.

766
00:53:19,385 --> 00:53:23,913
once you decrypt(descriptografar) it, you'll
know where the hack came from.

767
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,424
19 days.

768
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:42,489
no news, no arrests, no revolution.

769
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:58,920
no fbi, colby, evil corp.

770
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:05,005
_

771
00:54:13,509 --> 00:54:15,838
no mr. robot.

772
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,904
no fsociety.

773
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:29,028
i need to take my mind off things.

774
00:54:39,054 --> 00:54:41,670
- hello.
- hi, this is sam

775
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:44,115
from bank of e security fraud department.

776
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:46,013
unfortunately i have to inform you

777
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,812
that your account's been compromised.

778
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:52,091
- what? what happened?
- first before i can answer any questions,

779
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:53,687
i need to verify(verificar) some information.

780
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:58,122
- are you still at 306 hawthorne avenue?
- yes. apartment 2c.

781
00:54:58,123 --> 00:55:00,292
- _
- great. and your security question,

782
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:03,693
- favorite baseball team?
- um, yankees.

783
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:05,298
i don't remember this
being a security question.

784
00:55:05,299 --> 00:55:08,882
- and lastly, your pet's name?
- um, flipper.

785
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:12,657
who am i speaking to? can
i get your name and number?

786
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:14,989
with those details plus
a dictionary(dicionário) brute-force attack,

787
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:19,185
it'll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password.

788
00:55:26,814 --> 00:55:30,009
what i wouldn't give to be normal.

789
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:33,073
to live in that bubble,

790
00:55:33,075 --> 00:55:35,871
the reality of the naive.

791
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:44,231
that's how i justify(justificar) this.

792
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:47,329
to keep their optimism(otimismo) intact.

793
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:50,792
to protect them.

794
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,539
_

795
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,728
how? he's too old to have
a complicated password.

796
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:59,652
it had to have been a
combination of these things.

797
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:04,714
i'm missing something,
i'm missing something,

798
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:09,144
i'm missing something.

799
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:10,809
michael hansen isn't his real name.

800
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,133
come on. get over here.

801
00:56:25,232 --> 00:56:26,662
lenny shannon?

802
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:29,260
michael hansen?

803
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:32,724
which one are you playing tonight?

804
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:35,243
- you're going to stop seeing krista.
- what the f...

805
00:56:36,244 --> 00:56:38,533
you're going to break up with her.
you're never going to see her again.

806
00:56:39,852 --> 00:56:42,549
you're the guy that used my phone.

807
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:44,980
you cheated on your current
wife with seven different women.

808
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:46,982
i got digital proof of all of it.

809
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:50,908
ashley madison, online
escorts, fake facebook pages.

810
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,073
i own it all.

811
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:54,972
and if you don't stop seeing her,

812
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:59,101
your wife will know everything
along with the police.

813
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:02,326
- the police?
- yeah, one of the escorts(acompanhantes) was 15.

814
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,736
that 15 part i made up,

815
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:09,792
but he did have a
proclivity for young escorts

816
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:11,124
that helped the lie.

817
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:13,655
but i'm not gonna do any of that

818
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:16,187
as long as you break up with krista.

819
00:57:16,189 --> 00:57:18,252
tonight.

820
00:57:22,283 --> 00:57:25,146
done.

821
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:27,311
you're also gonna tell her the truth.

822
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:29,342
that you're married, cheat on your wife,

823
00:57:29,344 --> 00:57:31,607
you hire hookers.

824
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:34,737
that you never had any intention
of being serious with her.

825
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:36,170
why?

826
00:57:36,172 --> 00:57:37,269
that would destroy her.

827
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,600
she thinks that...

828
00:57:39,602 --> 00:57:41,566
we're in love.

829
00:57:41,568 --> 00:57:44,096
exactly. krista needs
to avoid dickheads like you

830
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:45,262
in the future.

831
00:57:45,264 --> 00:57:47,826
her radar needs fixing.

832
00:57:47,828 --> 00:57:50,758
i'll know if you skip any detail.

833
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,921
so don't.

834
00:57:54,923 --> 00:57:57,885
and one more thing...

835
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:00,815
i'm gonna need something from you.

836
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,678
come on.

837
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:21,898
hmm. i like you, flipper.

838
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,161
you're cool.

839
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:27,261
i never want to
be right about my hacks,

840
00:58:27,263 --> 00:58:30,025
but people always find a way to disappoint.

841
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:41,016
michael hansen now gets
filed away among the others.

842
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,381
forever buried in my digital cemetery.

843
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:54,604
the look of disillusionment.

844
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:57,168
he told her. she cried all night.

845
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,267
now comes the sadness.

846
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,695
i don't like seeing her sad.

847
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:08,459
- you okay?
- sorry.

848
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,162
sorry.

849
00:59:12,058 --> 00:59:15,254
go on.

850
00:59:15,256 --> 00:59:17,552
i think angela blames(culpa) me for what happened

851
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,016
at the evil corp meeting.

852
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,348
what do i do? i need to talk to her.

853
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,645
i think you just answered
your own question.

854
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:27,244
talk to her.

855
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:29,872
she won't respond to any
of my texts(texto s) or emails.

856
00:59:29,873 --> 00:59:31,973
then go to her in person.

857
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:35,137
tell her you need to talk.

858
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,501
communication is key, elliot.

859
00:59:38,503 --> 00:59:43,763
real human interaction.

860
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:46,460
that's what's important for you right now.

861

01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,012
you won't talk to me.

864
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:05,411
you haven't talked to me since the meeting.

865
01:00:05,413 --> 01:00:06,909
i don't want to talk to you

866
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:10,273
because i feel embarrassed

867
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:12,371
every time i think about what happened.

868
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:14,237

869
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,267

- i have to get back to work.

871
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:21,959
- you're just going to ignore me?
- you didn't have to stick up for me in there.

872
01:00:22,932 --> 01:00:24,361
i know that you were just trying to help,

873
01:00:24,363 --> 01:00:27,992

874
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:29,824

876
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:36,884

elliott.

881
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:25,110
fbi agents claim that
colby either used hacking groups

882
01:01:25,111 --> 01:01:27,027
or worked in conjunction with them

883
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:30,373
to pressure evil corp during
his contract negotiations.

884
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:33,203
after a long and exhaustive investigation,

885
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:37,434
sources close to the fbi
have confirmed the hacks were

886
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:41,030
in part tied to colby's terminal.

887
01:01:44,363 --> 01:01:47,825
it's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

888
01:01:56,486 --> 01:01:58,549
it's happening, it's happening,
it's happening, it's happening.

889
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:19,565
sir, step inside the car.

890
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,794
sir.

891
01:02:28,626 --> 01:02:31,022
step inside the vehicle now.

892
01:03:02,331 --> 01:03:04,427
go ahead.

893
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:06,492
sir, go on in.

894
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:12,253

895
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:08,206
